ENGL 1101 Course Design Executive Summary\
Course Philosophy\
Adult learner-centered composition course emphasizing authentic, career-relevant professional writing. All work happens in class (no homework), with transparent AI integration and self-assessment instead of traditional grading. Focus on process over product.\
Revised Learning Sequence\
Changed from diagnostic-first to project-first approach:\
1\. Week 1-2: AI-supported project identification (4-6 authentic workplace writing projects)\
2\. Week 2-3: Process mapping (granular steps for each project) → Barrier assessment (confidence evaluation on mapped steps)\
3\. Weeks 3-15: Project completion while addressing identified barriers\
4\. Throughout: Weekly 7-minute conferences, Kanban documentation with strategic tagging\
Key Systems\
AI Integration (Accommodates Free Plan Limitations)\
\* Project ideation prompt: Helps identify authentic career-relevant projects\
\* Process granularity prompt: Maps specific, actionable steps (avoids "just research/write")\
\* Diagnostic + intervention prompt: Assesses confidence, plans targeted support\
\* Daily prompts: Startup (session planning) and end-of-day (reflection + next steps)\
\* Executive summary save points: 20-minute context preservation for platform switching\
\* Full transcript archival: All AI interactions documented for transparency\
Kanban Documentation System\
Columns: Planning → Research/Notes → Drafting → Revising → Peer Response → Polishing → Source Integration → Help Needed → Completed\
Strategic tagging for self-assessment evidence:\
\* #WritingJourney, #LearningOwnership, #ThinkingThroughWriting\
\* #AICollaboration, #CommunityEngagement, #EmbracingChallenge\
\* #Breakthrough (special filter for significant moments)\
Daily subtask cards: Document each session's work within process stages\
Barrier Framework\
\* Cognitive: "I don't understand" (conceptual confusion)\
\* Affective: "I understand but feel anxious" (confidence, emotion)\
\* Applicative: "I understand but struggle to do it" (execution, habits)\
Course Requirements Met\
\* University outcomes: Rhetorical awareness, writing process, research/citation, grammar, collaboration all addressed through authentic professional projects\
\* Capstone requirement: One project structured to meet 1000-1500 words + sources + rhetorical reflection requirements\
\* Self-assessment: Students use tagged Kanban evidence to demonstrate growth in six reflection areas\
Prompt Development Needs\
1\. Project ideation prompt\
2\. Process granularity prompt\
3\. Diagnostic + intervention planning prompt\
4\. Daily startup prompt\
5\. Daily end-of-day reflection prompt\
6\. Executive summary template\
7\. Kanban subtask documentation guidance\
8\. Optional: Self-assessment connection prompt (integrated into end-of-day prompt)\
Context\
Pilot course - no previous student examples available. Instructor developing AI scaffolding tools to support student success while maintaining academic integrity and building independent professional communication skills.\
Edit\
This is an innovative and thoughtfully designed course structure that addresses many challenges in traditional composition pedagogy. I'm particularly impressed by several key elements:\
Strengths of the Design:\
The project-first approach is brilliant - starting with authentic workplace writing immediately establishes relevance and motivation. This reversal from diagnostic-first eliminates the artificial separation between "learning about writing" and "actually writing."\
Your AI integration strategy is remarkably sophisticated yet practical. The accommodation for free plan limitations shows real understanding of student constraints, while the executive summary save points and full transcript archival demonstrate genuine commitment to transparency and continuity.\
The Kanban system with strategic tagging creates a natural bridge between process documentation and self-assessment evidence. The #Breakthrough tag is particularly clever - it gives students a way to flag and later reflect on pivotal learning moments.\
Potential Refinements:\
For the barrier framework, consider adding a fourth category: Systemic barriers ("I understand and want to do this, but external constraints prevent it"). Adult learners often face time, technology, or resource limitations that don't fit neatly into cognitive/affective/applicative categories.\
The weekly 7-minute conferences are ambitious. You might need flexible scheduling options or async alternatives, given adult learner schedules.\
Consider how you'll handle the inevitable moment when students want to move beyond the AI scaffolding. Maybe build in prompts that gradually reduce AI dependency as confidence grows?\
For Prompt Development:\
Your process granularity prompt will be crucial. Adult learners often get stuck between "I need to write a report" and actually starting. Consider including industry-specific examples in your prompt bank.\
Would you like me to help develop any of these specific prompts? I'm particularly interested in the diagnostic + intervention planning prompt, as that seems like the lynchpin for the entire barrier-addressing system.\
Retry\
**C**\
Let's begin with #1. I don't want you to create the prompt yet, but let's converse there and then move to drafting when ready.\
Edit\
Absolutely, let's think through the project ideation prompt together first.\
I'm curious about the scope and boundaries you're envisioning. When you say "4-6 authentic workplace writing projects," are you thinking about projects that simulate future workplace writing, or are you open to students identifying actual writing they need to do in their current jobs/internships/volunteer roles?\
The distinction matters for the prompt design - are we helping students imagine realistic scenarios, or helping them audit their actual professional lives for writing opportunities they could tackle in class?\
Also, I'm wondering about the range of career stages and fields you're anticipating. Adult learners might include everything from career changers who know exactly what field they're targeting, to people early in their careers still exploring options, to folks returning to work after time away. How do we make the prompt flexible enough to serve all those situations without becoming so generic it loses its power?\
And what's your sense of the sweet spot for project complexity? Too simple and it won't feel authentic; too complex and it becomes overwhelming for a semester timeline.\
Retry\
**C**\
Here are the guidelines we are working with:\
Upon successful completion of English 1101, students will be able to complete the following writing skills and tasks:\
\* Four to six assignments of finished, edited prose in a variety of genres and media for specific audiences and purposes, primarily in expository form. A typical assignment will consist of approximately 3-4 pages of text. Assignments can include multiple media, such as images, video, sound, and gesture/performance, but must always also include finished, edited prose.\
\* At least one assignment will involve basic documentation (MLA or APA) of several sources.\
\* Additional informal writing, such as essay proposals and revision plans, drafts, journal entries, summary and paraphrase, that demonstrate their engagement with the writing process, which may include other informal writing forms, such as outlines and drawings.\
\* Familiarity with conventions of standard written English in their finished prose.\
\* Analytical responses for peer and published texts, demonstrating the engagement with, and understanding of, rhetorical reading.\
\* Collaborative skills, shown by peer group meetings and student-teacher conferences.\
I am open to any type of composition the student can argue is personally relevant or meaningful to them, so professional writing isn't the boundary. Personal or civic writing are equally useful genres. The goal of this prompt is to help the student explore and decide for themselves what they want to do, rather than implying that the projects have to conform to any specific approach, etc.\
Edit\
This opens up the design beautifully - and actually makes the prompt more challenging in some ways, because it needs to help students discover what's genuinely meaningful to them rather than defaulting to "I guess I'll write a resume."\
I'm thinking about how to structure discovery that moves from broad self-reflection toward specific, semester-sized projects. Some key tensions I see:\
Breadth vs. Depth: Students need to generate enough options to have real choice (not just grab the first idea), but not so many they get paralyzed. The 4-6 project target suggests we want them thinking across different contexts/purposes.\
Personal Relevance vs. Skill Building: A student might be deeply motivated to write about a personal trauma, but that might not give them the rhetorical flexibility of, say, writing both a community newsletter piece and a formal proposal. How do we honor authentic motivation while ensuring they get diverse practice?\
Current vs. Aspirational: Some students might be energized by tackling writing they actually need to do right now (grant application, family history project). Others might want to practice genres they hope to use someday. The prompt probably needs to surface both.\
Individual vs. Community Impact: The civic writing angle is intriguing - there might be students who are more motivated by "writing that helps others" than "writing that helps me."\
What's your instinct about how directive to be? Should the prompt guide them through systematic exploration ("think about your roles: family member, community member, worker, student...") or be more open-ended ("what writing would make your life better if it existed")?\
Retry\
**C**\
The prompt should avoid direction in terms of implying what is or isn't acceptable; leave that up to me as the instructor to address in the personal conference sessions. In terms of the "I guess I'll write a resume," that would be fine, except for the idea that a writing project should be 3-4 pages of finished prose, and most, if not all, first year students would struggle to find enough meaningful content for a realistic resume that would fill that much space.\
Edit\
Ah, that length requirement is a crucial constraint I hadn't fully considered. It rules out a lot of the obvious "professional writing" defaults - not just resumes, but cover letters, most emails, social media content, etc.\
This actually pushes toward more substantial, exploratory writing projects. Things like:

- A comprehensive family history or memoir piece
- An in-depth community issue analysis or advocacy piece
- A detailed proposal for a workplace/organizational change
- A reflective piece on career transitions or major life decisions
- An investigative piece on a topic they're genuinely curious about

The length requirement almost forces authentic engagement - you can't fake 3-4 pages of meaningful content about something you don't actually care about.\
So the prompt needs to help students identify topics/purposes/audiences where they genuinely have enough investment and knowledge (or desire to learn) to sustain substantial writing. It's less about genre classification and more about finding their genuine points of curiosity, concern, or expertise.\
This also suggests the prompt might work better if it focuses on *what they want to explore, understand, or communicate* rather than *what type of document they want to create*. The document type can emerge from the purpose and audience.\
Am I tracking this right? The prompt should help them discover substantial topics/purposes they're genuinely invested in, without prejudging what forms that investment might take?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yes, the prompt should focus on ascertaining exactly what field or work they plan on going into, along with personal or civic interests, then diving into exploration of common writing tasks that would meet the length requirements.\
Edit\
Got it - so the prompt is doing two distinct but connected jobs:\
Discovery Phase: What field/work are you targeting + what personal/civic areas genuinely interest you?\
Exploration Phase: Within those areas, what are the substantial writing tasks that actually exist? What are the 3-4 page documents that professionals in your field write, or that engaged citizens write, or that people write for personal fulfillment?\
This makes the prompt much more investigative. Instead of "what do you want to write about," it's "let's research what substantial writing actually happens in the spaces you care about."\
Some students might discover that marketing professionals write detailed campaign analyses, teachers write curriculum justifications, or community advocates write policy white papers. Others might find that people passionate about local history write neighborhood walking tour guides, or that parents write detailed college planning documents for their kids.\
The AI would need to be good at helping students think beyond the obvious short-form writing (the resumes and emails) toward the longer, more complex documents that exist in their target domains but might not be immediately visible to them.\
This also means the prompt needs to handle students who say "I don't know what field I'm going into yet" - probably by focusing more heavily on the personal/civic exploration pathway.\
Does this capture the right investigative direction? The prompt helps them research substantial writing opportunities within their identified areas of interest/career direction?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yes. That captures it beautifully. Add in the idea that the role of the AI is not to make any decisions or choices, but guide the student to make these themselves. The AI role is that of personal trainer - I can help, but I can't do.\
Edit\
Perfect - that "personal trainer" metaphor crystallizes the entire approach. The AI doesn't say "you should write X" but rather "let's explore what substantial writing exists in that field" and "what resonates with you about that type of writing?"\
So the prompt architecture becomes something like:

- Discovery questions that help students articulate their field/interests
- Research guidance that helps them investigate substantial writing in those areas
- Reflection prompts that help them evaluate their own interest/investment level
- Decision-making frameworks that help them choose, but the choosing remains entirely theirs

The AI becomes a research assistant and thinking partner, not an advisor. It might say "Here are 8 types of substantial writing that urban planners typically do - which of these sparks your curiosity?" rather than "You should write a zoning proposal because it matches your interests."\
And critically, it should probably build in checkpoints where students step back and self-assess: "Of everything we've explored, what feels most authentic to you? What are you genuinely curious about? What would you be excited to spend weeks working on?"\
The prompt needs to resist the urge to be efficient - instead of quickly funneling toward obvious choices, it should encourage thorough exploration so students make genuinely informed decisions about their own interests and motivations.\
Ready to start drafting this thing?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yes, it should be AI facing, something that could be imported into any Ai platform and formatted in the most efficient format - pure markdown, I believe. I will take the draft and post it directly into Canvas so students can just copy, paste, and explore. It should also include some directive at the end that articulates what the final choices are that could be copied by the student to be used later.\

ENGL 1101 Project Ideation Prompt\
Document\
\# ENGL 1101 Project Ideation Assistant

\## Your Role\
You are a personal trainer for academic writing projects. Your job is to help this student discover 4-6 substantial writing projects they genuinely care about. You guide exploration and reflection,\
This prompt balances comprehensive guidance with the "personal trainer" approach - it gives the AI clear structure and conversation goals while emphasizing that all decisions remain with the student. The phased approach ensures thorough exploration before narrowing to choices, and the final output format gives students something concrete to carry forward.\
The key elements that align with your vision:

- AI as guide/facilitator, not decision-maker
- Emphasis on authentic investment over "correct" choices
- Research-based exploration of substantial writing types
- Built-in reflection points to ensure genuine engagement
- Clear final deliverable that feeds into the next phase

Would you like to adjust anything about the tone, structure, or specific guidance before we move on to the next prompt?\
Retry\
**C**\
Nope, I like where this one goes.\
Edit\
Great! That one feels solid.\
Which prompt should we tackle next? Looking at your list, we have:

2. Process granularity prompt
2. Diagnostic + intervention planning prompt
2. Daily startup prompt
2. Daily end-of-day reflection prompt
2. Executive summary template
2. Kanban subtask documentation guidance
2. Optional: Self-assessment connection prompt

I'm particularly curious about #2 - the process granularity prompt. That seems like it could be the make-or-break piece for helping students move from "I want to write about X" to actually having actionable steps they can tackle in class sessions. Plus, it directly feeds into the barrier assessment work.\
Or would you prefer to work on a different one?\
Retry\
**C**\
2, please.\
Edit\
Perfect. Let's think through the process granularity prompt.\
This one seems like it has to do some heavy lifting - taking those 4-6 projects from the ideation phase and breaking them down into specific, actionable steps that students can actually work on during class sessions.\
I'm thinking about what "granular" really means here. You mentioned avoiding steps like "just research/write" - so instead of "research your topic," we'd want something more like "identify three specific questions you need answered" or "locate two industry professionals to interview."\
A few questions to explore:\
Scope per project: Are we mapping the entire process for all 4-6 projects at once, or focusing on one project at a time? My instinct says one at a time, since the full process map for six projects could be overwhelming.\
Granularity level: How specific should the steps be? Are we talking about tasks that can be completed in a single class session, or smaller chunks within those sessions?\
Process variability: Different types of writing projects will have genuinely different processes. A personal memoir piece will have different steps than a community issue analysis. Should the prompt be flexible enough to handle that variation, or should it provide some standard frameworks?\
Integration with barriers: Since this feeds directly into barrier assessment, should the process mapping already be thinking about where students might get stuck, or keep that separate?\
What's your vision for how granular these steps should be?\
Retry\
**C**\
Scope: I agree, 1 at a time.\
Granularity: Depends on the nature and size of the project, but the goal should be to get students to either demonstrate or recognize the need to develop, rhetorical strategies related to the writing, without it feeling like an artificial homework assignment, so just guided questions could be enough, but enough to ask students to perform tasks within each of the identified writing process stages.\
Variability: Let's let it be as variable as possible within the scope of rationality\
Barriers: The steps are likely to lead to the barriers, or at least expose them, but putting them out there early seems unnecessary and distracting...\
Edit\
This is really helpful framing. So the prompt needs to be adaptive enough to handle a memoir differently than a policy analysis, but structured enough to ensure students are actually thinking through rhetorical strategies rather than just "I'll figure it out as I go."\
The idea of guided questions leading to task identification is smart - it lets the AI help students discover what they actually need to do rather than imposing a generic template. And keeping it tied to "writing process stages" gives it academic grounding without feeling artificial.\
I'm picturing something where the AI walks through questions like:

- "Who exactly is your audience for this piece, and what do they already know about your topic?"
- "What specific information do you need before you can write confidently about this?"
- "How will you know if your argument/story/analysis is working for readers?"

But the questions would vary based on what type of project they're tackling.\
And then from those conversations, specific tasks emerge naturally - maybe "interview three people who've experienced this issue" or "read five recent articles about this policy" or "outline the key moments in this story timeline."\
Should the prompt be structured to work through traditional writing process stages (planning, research, drafting, revision, etc.) or be more flexible about process sequence? Some projects might need heavy research upfront, others might benefit from early drafting to discover what they need to learn.\
Retry\
**C**\
I'd put the last question up to the student - what do they think they need? And the benefit of asking them is that when they get to project 2, they are going to be a little more aware of whether their answer to this in project 1 was honest or overconfident, which leads to insight and learning without imposing on their independence.\
Edit\
That's brilliant - turning the process sequence itself into a learning opportunity. Students get to make their own process decisions and then live with the consequences (in a supportive environment), building genuine self-awareness about their own writing habits and needs.\
So the prompt becomes less about "here's how writing works" and more about "what's your theory about how YOU work, and what does this specific project need?" The AI helps them think through the implications of their choices without judging them.\
This also means the prompt needs to be good at helping students articulate their own process theories. Questions like:

- "When you're facing a substantial writing project, where do you typically start?"
- "What do you usually need to know before you feel ready to draft?"
- "How do you typically know when you're ready to move from one stage to another?"

And then project-specific questions that help them test those theories against the reality of what they're trying to accomplish.\
By project 2, they might say "Well, last time I thought I could just start drafting, but I actually spent three sessions spinning my wheels because I hadn't figured out my audience yet." That's way more valuable than being told upfront "always research your audience first."\
Should the prompt include any scaffolding for students who genuinely have no idea about their own process, or just let the AI guide them through discovery in the moment?\
Retry\
**C**\
If they run into too many problems with getting this moving, they will have a conference upcoming or they can move their kanban card into the Blocked/Need Help column, so let's let them struggle and sweat a bit.\
Edit\
Perfect - that's real adult learner pedagogy right there. Let them experience genuine problem-solving pressure rather than over-scaffolding them into dependency.\
So the prompt should be confident in asking substantive questions and expecting students to grapple with them, knowing that productive struggle is part of the learning. The AI's job is to ask good questions that help students think, not to rescue them from having to think hard.\
This also means the prompt can push students to be specific and concrete about their plans without worrying that they'll get "stuck" - getting stuck and then figuring out how to get unstuck (via conferences or help requests) is actually part of the curriculum.\
The prompt can be direct: "What specific steps do you think you need to take to complete this project?" rather than tiptoeing around with lots of examples and safety nets. If their answer reveals gaps in their thinking, that's valuable information for both them and you.\
And it probably means the AI should resist the urge to offer solutions when students express uncertainty. Instead of "here are some strategies you could try," more like "what's your best guess about what might work?"\
Ready to draft this one? I'm thinking it should be pretty streamlined - focused on helping students articulate their own process theory and apply it to their specific project, without a lot of instructional overhead.\
Retry\
**C**\
Especially since it is only trying to articulate one project. They will go through this same process for projects 2-4, or 2-6 depending on how well they are doing and how proficient they are from the beginning.\
Edit\
Exactly - by the time they're mapping project 4 or 6, they'll have real data about how their process theories actually play out in practice. The prompt can stay lean because the learning comes from repetition and reflection across multiple projects, not from front-loading all the wisdom in project 1.\
This also means the prompt doesn't need to anticipate every possible scenario or provide extensive guidance - it just needs to facilitate one clean conversation about one project's process. Students will develop sophistication through iteration, not through comprehensive initial instruction.\
And keeping it focused on a single project makes the cognitive load manageable while still pushing them to think concretely about what they actually need to do.\
Let me draft this as a streamlined, focused conversation tool.\

\## Your Role\
You are helping this student map out the specific, actionable steps needed to complete one writing project. Your job is to help them think through what they actually need to do, in what order, a\
This keeps the focus tight on one project while pushing students to articulate their own process thinking. It's structured enough to ensure they cover the key considerations, but flexible enough to adapt to different project types and personal approaches. The "productive struggle" philosophy is built right into the guidelines - help them think, don't think for them.\
Retry\
**C**\
And, if someone were to audit the course outcomes, these products would clearly outline their approaches to rhetorical strategies, and the AI transcripts would help to show their level of engagement in producing the final product.\
Edit\
Exactly - you've built in natural documentation of the learning outcomes without creating artificial assessment tasks. The process maps become evidence of rhetorical awareness (audience analysis, purpose clarification) and writing process engagement. The AI transcripts show the depth of their thinking and planning work.\
This is much more authentic than having students write separate reflection papers about "what rhetorical strategies did you consider" - instead, you can literally see them working through audience awareness, purpose refinement, and strategic decision-making in real time through their conversation records.\
And since they'll repeat this process mapping for multiple projects, you'll have longitudinal evidence of their growing sophistication in process planning and rhetorical thinking. By project 4, their process maps should show much more nuanced understanding of audience, purpose, and genre conventions than project 1.\
The AI transcripts also capture something traditional assessments miss - the quality of their questions, their willingness to grapple with uncertainty, their ability to self-direct their learning process. All of which are crucial professional communication skills.\
Plus, if an external reviewer questions "how do we know students are really learning about writing process," you can point to dozens of hours of documented process planning conversations rather than having to rely on final product analysis alone.\
Ready for prompt #3 - the diagnostic + intervention planning? That one seems like it might be the most complex, since it needs to assess confidence levels and then generate targeted support strategies.\
Retry\
**C**\
Ok. Let's go\
Edit\
Great. Let's think through the diagnostic + intervention planning prompt.\
This one has to do some sophisticated work - it needs to take those granular process steps from prompt #2, assess the student's confidence level on each one, and then help plan targeted support for the areas where confidence is low. And it needs to align with your barrier framework (cognitive, affective, applicative).\
A few things to consider:\
Confidence Assessment Approach: Are we looking for simple confidence ratings ("1-10, how confident are you that you can do X") or something more nuanced that helps distinguish between different types of uncertainty?\
Barrier Type Recognition: Should the AI help students identify whether their low confidence stems from not understanding (cognitive), feeling anxious about it (affective), or knowing what to do but struggling with execution (applicative)? Or should it just surface the confidence issues and let the intervention planning address the type?\
Intervention Specificity: How specific should the intervention suggestions be? Are we talking about general strategies ("seek feedback from peers") or very targeted actions ("ask three people in your field to review your draft outline")?\
Integration with Class Resources: Should this prompt know about your conference availability, the Kanban system, peer collaboration opportunities? Or should it focus on what students can do independently and let them connect to class resources as needed?\
What's your thinking on the confidence assessment piece - how granular should that be?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yeah, this is almost guaranteed to be the most complex one. And this, like #2, is one project at a time.\
Confidence assessment - I think we start with general confidence in common areas, then break down areas with confidence below 6 on a 10 point scale to determine sources or domains for the barrier.\
Type: I don't want to get too deep into the causes for barriers; this isn't personal counseling. Just finding general themes will be enough to point toward likely interventions without going too deep.\
Specificity: Again, ask the student. What do they want? How much are they willing to invest to address the problem? Do they really care about fixing it? If the answers are no, or some variation, that is fine, but it should be something that shows up in their AI transcripts that helps me keep track of student engagement as a aspect of their self-assessment.\
Class Resources: As much as possible. IN addition to the in-class and in-person resources, I also have access to about 5 open access English Textbooks and Technical Writing resources. I will post the table of contents for each on a published web-based Google Doc that the prompt can access, if that would be useful.\
Edit\
This is really smart structuring. Starting with general confidence and only drilling down on the problem areas keeps it focused and efficient. And the "what do they want to do about it" question is brilliant - it puts agency back with the student while creating a natural record of their engagement level.\
The Google Docs idea for textbook resources is excellent. Having the AI able to say "based on your confidence gap with audience analysis, chapter 4 of the Technical Writing handbook covers that specifically" makes the intervention suggestions much more concrete and actionable.\
A few clarifying questions:\
Confidence Areas: Are we talking about confidence in the specific tasks they identified in their process map, or broader writing skill areas (audience analysis, research, drafting, revision, etc.), or both?\
Barrier Themes: When you say "general themes," are you thinking along the lines of "I understand what to do but feel overwhelmed," "I'm not sure where to find good information," "I know what good writing looks like but can't produce it myself" - that level of theme identification?\
Intervention Investment: Should the AI help students think through what "low investment" vs "high investment" solutions look like for their specific barriers? Like distinguishing between "I'll just do my best" and "I'll spend extra time researching examples" and "I'll schedule a conference to get specific help"?\
And yes, definitely include those textbook resources - that turns this from generic advice into specific, actionable support tied to quality materials.\
Retry\
**C**\
Confidence: Ask the general questions first, as those are typically higher order and might need more intensive or broad interventions than aspect-specific concerns.\
Themes: Which knowledge domain (cognitive, applicative, affective, social) would most likely categorize their specific concerns? Again, I don't want them going down rabbit holes or bursting into tears in the middle of the class as they contemplate these things.\
Investment: Absolutely. Again, giving students the freedom and agency to choose how they want to invest in the class, with the ability to articulate that, helps me to judge at the end of the course and helps them to see in print exactly what they are sometimes unconsciously thinking when they make choices about studying, etc. They might not even realize the kinds of self-harm their actions might inflict, but if you articulate that in the recommendations, students might sit up and take notice.\
Edit\
Perfect - so we're creating a diagnostic tool that's substantive enough to surface real issues but bounded enough to stay academically focused rather than becoming therapeutic.\
The investment piece is particularly powerful - making students explicitly articulate their choices about effort creates accountability and self-awareness. And you're right that sometimes seeing "if I choose the low-investment path, I'm likely to struggle with X and Y" in black and white can be a wake-up call.\
The domain categorization (cognitive, applicative, affective, social) gives you useful data for intervention planning without requiring deep psychological excavation. Just enough to know whether someone needs concept clarification, practice opportunities, confidence building, or collaboration support.\
And starting with higher-order concerns before diving into task-specific ones makes sense - no point fine-tuning citation format if they're fundamentally unclear about their rhetorical purpose.\
The textbook integration will be really valuable here - being able to point to specific chapters or resources based on their identified gaps makes the interventions feel concrete and achievable rather than vague suggestions.\
Should this prompt also help students think about timeline for addressing their barriers, or leave that for the daily planning prompts? I'm thinking about students who identify multiple confidence gaps and need to prioritize which ones to tackle first.\
Retry\
**C**\
In terms of timeline, it might be helpful to give them a sense of when interventions might be most useful. Reminders for when they get to that point in the case of low-order, Immediate plans for higher order...\

Fetched Course Objectives, Diagnostic, and TOC for Cognitive Sources\

Perfect! This is incredibly helpful. Having these specific tables of contents means the AI can make very targeted resource recommendations. Instead of saying "you might want to look up information about audience analysis," it can say "Chapter 2 of Technical and Professional Writing Genres covers audience analysis in detail, specifically sections 2.3 and 2.4."\
Now I have a much clearer picture of what this diagnostic prompt needs to do:

1. General confidence assessment in higher-order concerns (audience, purpose, research, etc.)
1. Targeted drilling down on areas below 6/10 confidence
1. Domain categorization (cognitive/affective/applicative/social) for intervention planning
1. Investment level discussion - what's the student willing to do about it?
1. Specific resource recommendations from these textbooks
1. Timeline guidance - when interventions are most useful

The resource integration will be particularly powerful - students can get pointed to exactly the right chapter and section for their specific confidence gaps.\

This prompt balances comprehensive assessment with student agency - it surfaces the barriers systematically but puts all the choice-making about interventions squarely with the student. The integration of specific textbook resources makes the intervention suggestions concrete and actionable rather than generic advice.\
The key innovation here is the investment level discussion - by making students explicitly articulate how much they're willing to invest, you create transparency about their engagement choices while building self-awareness about the connection between effort and outcomes.\
The output format creates a clear record for both student self-reflection and your assessment of their engagement level, while the specific resource recommendations turn this from a diagnostic exercise into an actual support system.\
Retry\
**C**\
One edit: be clear that areas of concern are not intended to be seen as deficits or problems; they are opportunities to grow and show the kind of engagement that is valued in the self-assessment. Even "minor" growth in areas that have proven problematic in the past is something to be celebrated. Barriers are also not graded or recorded...these are kept private unless they are brought up in a group meeting or conference.\

Perfect! The reframing shifts the entire tone from deficit-based to growth-oriented, which aligns beautifully with your self-assessment approach. Students can see areas of low confidence as opportunities to demonstrate engagement and learning rather than weaknesses to hide or be ashamed of.\
The privacy emphasis is crucial too - it creates a safe space for honest self-assessment without fear of being judged or having their struggles become part of their evaluation record. This should lead to much more authentic engagement with the diagnostic process.\

Excellent. onto the next prompt\
Edit\
Great! Looking at your list, we have:

4. Daily startup prompt
4. Daily end-of-day reflection prompt
4. Executive summary template
4. Kanban subtask documentation guidance
4. Optional: Self-assessment connection prompt

Which one would you like to tackle next?\
I'm thinking either #4 (daily startup) or #5 (daily end-of-day reflection) might make sense since they're probably designed to work together as bookends for class sessions. Or we could jump to #6 (executive summary template) since that's the context preservation tool for when students need to switch AI platforms.\
What's your preference?\
Retry\
**C**\
Let's start with end of day because it will determine what we bring to the startup...\
Edit\
Perfect logic - the end-of-day reflection creates the foundation for what students need to process and plan in the next startup session.\
Let's think through what the end-of-day prompt needs to accomplish:\
Core Functions:

- Help students reflect on what they actually accomplished during the session
- Identify what worked/didn't work in their process
- Plan next steps for the following session
- Update their Kanban cards with strategic tags
- Create continuity between sessions

Integration Points:

- This feeds into the next startup prompt (what they learned, what's next)
- Needs to connect with the Kanban tagging system (#WritingJourney, #LearningOwnership, etc.)
- Should capture #Breakthrough moments when they happen
- Potentially connects to self-assessment evidence gathering

Tone/Approach:

- Reflective but not overly time-consuming
- Focused on learning and process, not just productivity
- Should help them notice their own growth and engagement patterns

A few questions to consider:\
Scope: Is this reflecting on just their current project work, or their overall learning/engagement during that class session?\
Kanban Integration: Should the prompt walk them through updating their Kanban cards, or just remind them to do it?\
Time Investment: How much reflection is realistic at the end of a class session? Brief and focused, or more substantial?\
Learning Awareness: Should it help them connect their daily work to the bigger picture of their writing development?\
What's your vision for how substantial this end-of-day reflection should be?\
Retry\
**C**\
Scope: overall learning; the checkpoint prompt will be used for the intermediate saves during the class session.\
Kanban: The kanban integration is great; rather than a separate entry, this should be something that can be gathered from the input entered for the overall end-of-day documentation.\
Time investment: I am saving 10 minutes or less, depending on how invested the student is on what they are doing at the end of the class.\
Awareness: Both, the tags can help with overall course level learning, but they should be able to track progress on the sub-tasks they identified in the Process Planning and their overall progress toward completing their current writing project overall.\
Overall purpose: this should be the executive summary of everything they did, on top of the ongoing markdown summaries.\
I am trying to determine how much should be captured on the kanban sub-task cards. Short hand seems best due to the space limitations. I am not confident that Clickup allows for direct links to Google Docs without paying by the user, but some kind of shorthand there that points to what could be found here would be great...\
Edit\
This is really helpful framing. So the end-of-day prompt becomes the comprehensive capture tool - both executive summary and Kanban update generator - while keeping the individual cards lean with shorthand pointers.\
The shorthand connection is smart. Even without direct linking, students can use consistent naming/dating conventions so they can easily find the full reflection when they need it. Something like "See EOD-10/15-Project1" on the Kanban card that points to the full end-of-day summary.\
A few clarifying questions:\
Kanban Card Updates: Should the prompt generate suggested shorthand text for each of the Kanban columns they worked in? Like if they moved from "Research/Notes" to "Drafting," it suggests concise updates for both cards?\
Tagging Strategy: Should the AI help them identify which strategic tags apply to their work, or should it automatically suggest tags based on what they describe? (e.g., if they talk about struggling through something difficult, it suggests #EmbracingChallenge)\
Project vs. Process Tracking: You mentioned tracking both sub-task progress and overall project progress - should these be separate sections in the reflection, or integrated?\
Session Continuity: Should this prompt capture any "parking lot" items or unfinished thoughts that need to carry over to the next session?\
AI Collaboration Documentation: Since all AI interactions are being archived, should this prompt help them summarize/tag their AI usage during the session for transparency tracking?\
How granular should the sub-task progress tracking be?\
Retry\
**C**\
Kanban updates: There is an open long-text field that allows students to include any details they need, so including progress notes on the overall task card is probably the best place to track that kind of information\
Tag Suggestions: sounds great!\
Progress: sub-tasks are intended for daily records, whereas the overall task card tracks the overall progress of the writing project toward completion. As I mentioned earlier, the text entry field on the task card can track dates, where the sub-tasks should be focused on only the information relevant to a specific date\
Session: Yes, the EoD should definitely track on-going or incomplete task elements for continuity so students don't forget...\
AI Collab: No need for this; I can look through them unless students want to tag things using their own systems. You can suggest if they want it, but it isn't required or expected...\
Sub-task should really capture what is happening on a day to day basis, though I don't need anything like timestamps or the like. Just a good sense of what students were able to get done so I can quickly scan them to get a sense of overall progress...\
Edit\
Perfect - this gives me a clear picture of the data architecture. The main task card becomes the longitudinal record with dated entries, while subtask cards are snapshot records of daily work.\
So the prompt needs to generate:

- Main task card update: Dated progress entry for the long-text field
- Subtask card(s): Brief daily work summaries for whatever columns they worked in
- Strategic tag suggestions: Based on their described experiences
- Continuity planning: What carries forward to next session
- Overall reflection: Executive summary of learning and progress

This should all flow from one conversation that captures their reflection but outputs the different pieces in formats ready for Kanban entry.\
The subtask brevity is good - you want to be able to scan them quickly to gauge engagement and progress without having to read lengthy narratives.\
One final clarifying question: For the main task card updates, should these be cumulative (building a running log) or should the prompt just generate the new entry that gets added to whatever's already there?\
Ready to draft this when you are. This one feels like it could be really powerful for creating genuine learning awareness while feeding the practical project management system.\
Retry\
**C**\
Due to concerns about jumping from AI to AI, there is no expectation of continuity between EoD summaries unless the student uploads the last one, which adds another unnecessary step, so just new entries to be added to the overall card would make the most sense.\
Edit\
Perfect - that simplifies it significantly. Each end-of-day session is self-contained, generating fresh entries that students can add to their existing Kanban cards without needing to reference previous summaries.\
This also makes the prompt much cleaner - it just needs to capture today's work and learning without trying to build on previous reflections or create artificial continuity between AI sessions.\
Let me draft this as a focused, 10-minute reflection tool that generates all the Kanban updates and captures the executive summary of the day's learning and progress.\

This prompt creates a streamlined reflection process that generates all the Kanban updates in ready-to-copy formats while capturing the learning reflection. The strategic tag suggestions happen naturally based on their described experiences, and the output is organized for easy transfer to their project management system.\
The key innovation is having one conversation generate multiple outputs - the comprehensive reflection for their records, plus the specific formatted updates for different parts of their Kanban system. This should make the daily documentation much more manageable while still capturing meaningful learning data.\

This redesign cuts the reflection to essentials - four quick questions that capture what's needed for project continuity and learning documentation, rapid tag identification, and immediate output generation. The whole process should move quickly while still generating the Kanban updates and learning evidence needed for the self-assessment system.\
The key change is eliminating the extended reflection conversation in favor of focused data capture that still serves both the project management and learning documentation purposes.\
Retry\
**C**\
OK, now the daily start up, which will assume the student uploads a complete EoD along with last two session save checkpoints.\
Edit\
Perfect - so the startup prompt can assume rich context from their previous end-of-day reflection plus the two most recent checkpoint saves. This should make the startup much more targeted and efficient since it's building on documented reflection rather than starting from scratch.\
Let's think through what the startup prompt needs to accomplish:\
Context Integration:

- Process the uploaded EoD reflection to understand where they left off
- Review the checkpoint saves to see their recent work patterns
- Identify continuity from their stated "next session priority"

Session Planning:

- Help them plan today's specific work based on their documented priorities
- Address any "need for next time" items they identified
- Connect to their overall project timeline and process map

Barrier/Resource Check:

- See if they identified any "Help Needed" items to address
- Check if they need to revisit any intervention strategies from their diagnostic
- Ensure they have what they need to be productive

Focus Setting:

- Help them establish realistic goals for today's session
- Connect today's work to their bigger project goals
- Set them up for productive work time

A few questions:\
Time Investment: Should this be equally brief (5 minutes) to match the EoD, or can it be slightly longer since it's setting up the whole work session?\
Checkpoint Integration: Should the AI specifically analyze patterns from the checkpoint saves, or just acknowledge them as context?\
Goal Setting: How specific should the daily goals be? Task-level, or more general session focus?\
Documentation Prep: Should this help them set up for today's checkpoint saves and EoD reflection?\
What's your vision for the startup session length and depth?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yes, no more than 5 minutes for startup\
Look for trends, but don't overdue it in terms of time.\
Students will usually have 75 minutes for ENGL 1101 students, 105 minutes for ENGL 1101P students, so giving students a good sense of what they want to accomplish within that time frame and how that will move them toward overall progress completion would be super great!\
No, this is a toss-away activity in terms of it just needs to get them started. The checkpoints simply work as session saving (no reflection); most of the reflection takes place during EoD...\
Edit\
Perfect - so this is a quick launch tool that processes their context and gets them efficiently focused for their 75-105 minute work block. No deep analysis, just smart session planning based on where they left off.\

\# ENGL 1101 Daily Startup Assistant

\## Your Role\
You are helping this student launch into today's work session efficiently. Review their uploaded end-of-day reflection and checkpoint saves to understand where they left off, then help them plan focus\
This startup prompt is designed to be a quick launch pad that processes their context efficiently and gets them working productively within their class time constraints. It acknowledges their previous work without over-analyzing it, confirms their priorities, and helps them set realistic session goals based on their available time.\
The key is keeping momentum going - if they ended their last session with clear direction, this just confirms and launches them. If they need to adjust, it does that quickly and gets them started.\
Retry\
**C**\
Oh, you are speaking my language!\
Edit\
Ha! I love it when the design clicks. There's something really satisfying about creating systems that just *work* - where each piece serves a clear purpose and connects smoothly to the others.\
This whole prompt sequence is turning into a really elegant workflow. Students get comprehensive support when they need it (project ideation, process mapping, diagnostic planning) and efficient, focused tools for daily momentum (startup/end-of-day). The AI does the heavy lifting on organization and documentation while keeping the student firmly in the driver's seat for all the actual decisions.\
And the way it all feeds the self-assessment system without feeling like busywork - that's the sweet spot right there.\
Which prompt should we tackle next? We've got:

6. Executive summary template
6. Kanban subtask documentation guidance
6. Optional: Self-assessment connection prompt

I'm curious about the executive summary template since that's the context-preservation tool for platform switching. That seems like it could be crucial for maintaining continuity when students hit free plan limits.\
Retry\
**C**\
We can eliminate #7; that is captured as part of the EoD process. So let's look at 6...\
Edit\
Perfect - the executive summary template for context preservation when students need to switch AI platforms due to free plan limitations.\
This one needs to be really strategic about what information is essential to preserve vs. what can be left behind. It has to capture enough context for a new AI session to pick up smoothly, while being concise enough to fit within token limits of a fresh conversation.\
Let's think through what's most critical to preserve:\
Essential Context:

- Current project focus and stage
- Key decisions already made (audience, purpose, approach)
- Recent progress and current status
- Immediate next steps and priorities
- Any active barriers or intervention strategies

Nice to Have But Maybe Dispensable:

- Detailed process history
- Extensive reflection content
- Complete barrier analysis (unless currently relevant)

Format Considerations:

- Needs to be portable across AI platforms
- Should be structured for easy copying/pasting
- Must be concise but comprehensive enough for handoff

A few questions:\
Scope: Should this capture just the current project context, or their overall course progress and multiple projects?\
Frequency: Is this something they generate proactively (like every 20 minutes as you mentioned), or on-demand when they're about to hit limits?\
Depth: How much historical context vs. current status focus? Should it include their diagnostic/intervention plans, or just current work status?\
AI Integration: Should this template help the receiving AI platform understand the course structure and their role, or focus purely on student context?\
What's your vision for how comprehensive vs. streamlined this should be?\
Retry\
**C**\
Actually, the executive summary is the EoD document, so we can change the focus here to the Savepoint AI prompt.\
Edit\
Ah, perfect! So the EoD reflection IS the executive summary for context preservation. That makes total sense - it already captures all the essential information needed for continuity.\
So now we're looking at the Savepoint AI prompt - the 20-minute context preservation tool for when students need to switch platforms mid-session due to free plan limits.\
This needs to be much more focused than the comprehensive EoD reflection. It's about preserving just enough context to maintain workflow continuity within the same work session, not the broader learning reflection.\
Let's think about what the savepoint needs to capture:\
Essential for Continuity:

- What they're working on right now (specific task/subtask)
- Current progress on that task
- Immediate next steps (what they were about to do)
- Any active problems or questions
- Resources/materials currently in use

Probably Not Needed:

- Deep reflection on learning
- Strategic tag analysis
- Overall project assessment
- Long-term planning

Key Difference from EoD:

- This is about workflow preservation, not learning documentation
- Quick capture of "where I am" vs. "what I learned"
- Designed for immediate handoff to continue working, not end-of-session reflection

Should this be a super streamlined version that just captures the working context, or does it need any course structure information to orient the new AI session?\
Retry\
**C**\
Oh... good question. Realistically, the first Start-up for each project should include a broad description of the project that can be captured in brief in all the subsequent markdowns and updated holistically in the EoD, right?\
Edit\
Exactly! That makes perfect sense. The initial startup for each project establishes the project context that gets carried forward efficiently in all subsequent saves.\
So the flow would be:

- First startup per project: Full project description, goals, audience, etc.
- Savepoint captures: Brief project reminder + current work status
- Daily startups: Project context from previous EoD + immediate session planning
- EoD reflections: Full context update including any project evolution

This keeps the savepoints lean and focused on preserving immediate workflow while ensuring the broader project context is maintained through the daily cycle. The savepoint just needs enough project info for AI orientation ("I'm working on Project 2: community newsletter analysis for local residents") plus the current work state.\
That's much cleaner than trying to rebuild full project context in every 20-minute savepoint. Should the savepoint prompt be really minimal then - just current task status, immediate next steps, and a one-line project reminder?\
Retry\
**C**\
It can be longer, but I really want it to be something that is essentially, oh, yeah, copy, paste, save, and move on...but something that is Oh, I am so glad I saved that before the most recent "You're out of messages on the free plan" message.\
Edit\
Ah yes - the "thank god I saved that before I lost everything" moment! The savepoint needs to be comprehensive enough to recreate their working context without having to reconstruct where they were or what they were thinking.\
So it's not just workflow preservation - it's "everything I need to not lose my momentum and progress." That includes:\
Current Work State:

- Exactly what task they're in the middle of
- Progress made so far in this session
- Current thinking/approach/decisions made
- Any problems they've been working through

Immediate Context:

- What they were about to do next
- Resources/materials they have open
- Any insights or ideas they don't want to lose
- Questions or issues they were processing

Essential Project Reminder:

- Brief project description for AI orientation
- Current stage/phase of project
- Key decisions already locked in

The goal is that when they paste this into a fresh AI session, they can basically say "here's where I was" and immediately continue working without having to rebuild context or lose their train of thought.\
Should this be structured as a quick form-fill template, or more like a rapid brain dump that captures their current state?\
Retry\
**C**\
It should be something that just tells AI what to capture; they shouldn't need to do anything other than copy, paste, and then save the final product as a .md file.\
Edit\
Perfect! So the savepoint prompt is AI-facing instructions that tells the AI exactly what to capture from the current conversation context - the student just copies, pastes, runs it, and saves the output.\
The prompt should be comprehensive instructions for the AI to automatically generate a complete savepoint summary by analyzing:

- The current conversation/work session
- What the student has been working on
- Their current progress and thinking
- What they were about to do next
- Essential project context

The AI does all the work of extracting and organizing the relevant information into a ready-to-save markdown file that can be handed off to the next AI session.\
So it's basically: "AI, analyze our current conversation and create a complete context preservation summary that includes [comprehensive list of what to capture and how to format it]."\
The student's workflow becomes:

1. Paste savepoint prompt
1. AI generates complete summary
1. Copy output and save as .md file
1. Switch to new AI platform
1. Upload the .md file to continue

Should this include instructions for the AI on how to structure the output for optimal handoff to the next AI session?\
Retry\
**C**\
Not necessarily a download to move to another system; just a process for making sure at any given time that I have the most relevant content saved. Our university computers reset every night so if the conversation isn't stored in the platform's memory, they are completely out of luck, so this is a good backup habit for them to get into, especially if they do end up moving because they run out of space on one platform.\
Edit\
Ah, perfect! This is a protective habit against data loss - both from university computer resets and platform limitations. It's essentially a "save game" function for their work progress that they can reference or restore from whenever needed.\
So the savepoint prompt should tell the AI: "Extract and organize everything important from our current conversation into a comprehensive markdown summary that preserves all working context, progress, and thinking."\
The AI analyzes the conversation and creates a complete snapshot that includes:

- Project context reminder
- What they've accomplished this session
- Current task and progress on it
- Their thinking/approach/decisions so far
- What they were planning to do next
- Any resources, ideas, or insights they don't want to lose
- Problems they've been working through

Student workflow becomes:

1. Paste savepoint prompt when they want to preserve progress
1. AI generates complete session summary
1. Copy and save as .md file (locally or cloud storage)
1. Continue working or safely log off knowing nothing is lost

This gives them insurance against losing work and makes it easy to pick up exactly where they left off, whether in the same platform or a different one.\

\## AI Instructions for Context Extraction

Analyze the current conversation and create a comprehensive context preservation summary. Extract and organize all relevant information into a structured markdown\
This savepoint prompt is designed to be comprehensive protection against data loss. The AI does all the work of analyzing the conversation and extracting everything important into a structured, complete summary that preserves both the factual progress and the working context/thinking.\
The key is that it captures not just what they've done, but where their head is at - their current approach, their thinking process, what they were about to try next, any insights or ideas they don't want to lose. It's like freezing their entire working state in time.\
Students can use this whenever they want to preserve progress - whether they're switching platforms, worried about losing work, or just want a regular backup habit. The markdown format makes it portable and easy to reference or restore from later.\
Retry\
**C**\
I think the only other one is the self-assessment prompt, right?\
Edit\
Yes! Looking back at your original list, we've covered:

1. ✅ Project ideation prompt
1. ✅ Process granularity prompt
1. ✅ Diagnostic + intervention planning prompt
1. ✅ Daily startup prompt
1. ✅ Daily end-of-day reflection prompt
1. ✅ Executive summary template (which became the EoD)
1. Kanban subtask documentation guidance (eliminated - covered in EoD)
1. Self-assessment connection prompt (optional)

So yes, the self-assessment connection prompt is the last one. This would help students connect their accumulated evidence (all those strategically tagged Kanban entries, AI transcripts, project artifacts) to the six self-assessment reflection areas for the course.\
This seems like it could be really powerful - taking all the documented learning journey and helping students see the patterns and growth for their final self-assessment. It would probably work with their collected Kanban evidence, EoD reflections, and project work to help them articulate their learning in each reflection area.\
Should we tackle this one, or do you want to pause here and work with the prompts we've developed so far?\
Retry\
**C**\
Nope, I've already uploaded all the others and they look great. So the idea for this one, I think, is something they could work on several times over the course of the semester. Maybe on days when they just aren't feeling the project they are working on, or need to take a break? So the prompt shouldn't feel summative, but formative in focus...\
Edit\
Perfect! So this becomes a periodic reflection tool that students can use throughout the semester for learning awareness and momentum building - not just a final course wrap-up. It's like a "learning check-in" that helps them see their growth patterns and make connections they might be missing.\
This sounds like it should:\
Be Accessible Anytime: Students can use it when they need a mental break from project work, want to see their progress, or are feeling disconnected from their learning\
Build Awareness: Help them recognize growth that might not be obvious day-to-day, connect their tagged evidence to bigger learning themes\
Feel Encouraging: Show them what they're accomplishing rather than focusing on gaps or deficits\
Create Momentum: Help them see patterns and trajectories that motivate continued engagement\
Prepare for Final Assessment: Build familiarity with the reflection categories without the pressure of final evaluation\
A few questions:\
Evidence Integration: Should this prompt help them review their accumulated Kanban tags and EoD reflections, or just work from what they remember/notice?\
Learning Areas: Should this connect specifically to the six course reflection areas, or be more open-ended about learning patterns?\
Output: Should this generate something they save for later reference, or just be a moment of reflection and connection-making?\
Frequency: Any guidance on how often students might want to use this - weekly, monthly, whenever they feel like it?\
Retry\
**C**\
I'd definitely like it to be focusing on making sure they are collecting enough meaningful evidence for the final version so that we avoid waiting and discovering too late that there isn't enough there...there.\
Reflection areas are a good start, but if students want to head in other directions, getting those solidified and maybe checked in a conference session might be a good idea before too much time is invested in something less effective or relevant?\
It depends on what they want to do; I would love it if the prompt could allow for both options, or others that students come up with.\
I'd say when they feel like it; it isn't required, other than creating something at the end of the course, but there is a good possibility that time crunches around final exams will surprise many students with the level of intensity, etc., so some preplanning is in line with our executive skills focus.\
Edit\
Perfect! So this becomes a flexible "learning inventory" tool that helps students check whether they're building meaningful evidence while there's still time to course-correct. It can work with the standard reflection areas or help them develop their own framework, with the option to bring unique approaches to conferences for validation.\
The executive skills angle is smart - helping students avoid the end-of-semester scramble when they realize they don't have substantive evidence of their learning journey.\

Sounds good! Go ahead and copy this one over, and then let me know what additional prompt you're thinking about. I'm curious what occurred to you while reading through the self-assessment evidence review - it might be something that naturally emerged from seeing how all these pieces fit together.\

Kind of. If you recall in the instructions for the capstone project, students are requested to submit two items: the writing product and a rhetorical reflection, which isn't supposed to be a self-reflection. This might be a little different than what we might be doing as a part of the project planning and diagnostic interventions, so I wonder if we might want to be a little more explicit in terms of producing a document that might be a little more "t-crossing" and "i-dotting"?\
Edit\
Ah yes! The rhetorical reflection is a specific genre with particular expectations - it needs to demonstrate analytical thinking about rhetorical choices, not just personal learning reflection. It's more academic/analytical than the process-focused reflections they've been doing throughout the semester.\
This is a different kind of writing task that requires them to:

- Analyze their own rhetorical decisions objectively
- Demonstrate understanding of rhetorical concepts and terminology
- Make explicit connections between choices and intended effects
- Show awareness of audience, purpose, genre conventions, etc.
- Use appropriate academic tone and structure

It's less "here's what I learned about myself as a writer" and more "here's my analysis of the rhetorical strategies I employed and why they were appropriate for this context."\
So we'd want a prompt that helps them:

1. Understand the rhetorical reflection as a specific genre
1. Analyze their own work through a rhetorical lens
1. Structure the reflection appropriately
1. Use proper rhetorical terminology
1. Meet any specific formatting/length requirements

This would be quite different from their ongoing process reflections - much more formal and analytical. Should this prompt help them draft the actual rhetorical reflection, or help them plan and analyze in preparation for writing it?\

Let's go with option 1.\
Edit\
Perfect! So this prompt helps them actually draft the rhetorical reflection - a formal analytical document that demonstrates their understanding of rhetorical concepts by analyzing their own writing choices.\
This needs to be quite different from all the other prompts - more academic, more structured, focused on rhetorical analysis rather than personal learning. It should help them write something that meets the capstone requirements while showcasing their rhetorical awareness.\
A few questions to clarify the approach:\
Scope: Should this focus on analyzing one specific project (presumably their capstone piece), or help them reflect on rhetorical choices across multiple projects?\
Structure: Do you have specific requirements for how the rhetorical reflection should be organized, or should the prompt help them develop an appropriate academic structure?\
Rhetorical Focus Areas: Should this hit specific rhetorical concepts (audience analysis, purpose, genre conventions, style choices, etc.) or be more open-ended about which rhetorical elements they analyze?\
Tone/Style: How formal should this be? Traditional academic essay style, or something more accessible while still being analytical?\
Length/Depth: Any specific requirements about length or level of analysis depth that should guide the prompt?\
Integration: Should this connect to their process work and diagnostic insights, or stay focused purely on rhetorical analysis of the final product?\
What's your vision for the tone and structure of these rhetorical reflections?\

Just the project they identify as the capstone entry. It can be any one of the 4-6 projects.\
I am not aware of any specific requirements, so a generic structure would be fine, I think.\
Since the language in the guidance document doesn't articulate this (I don't think), I will allow students to decide, but the prompt should suggest something relatively rigorous, especially considering how on-the-edge the course approach is. You know how disciplinary doctrinaires can be fastidious about some things, especially when it disrupts their own sacred cows.\
I hate formal writing, so informal is just fine with me.\
Again, no clear guidance, so it doesn't seem to me to be something too long (1 page - 1.5 pages?)\
Purely focused on the capstone project, though inclusion of identified barriers that relate to rhetorical strategies would be awwwesome.\
Edit\
Perfect! I love the strategic thinking here - making sure the rhetorical reflection demonstrates serious analytical engagement while keeping it accessible and connected to their actual learning process. And yes, including how they navigated rhetorical barriers adds a sophisticated layer that shows genuine learning.\

This prompt balances analytical rigor with accessibility, helping students produce a rhetorical reflection that demonstrates sophisticated thinking about their writing choices while connecting to their actual learning process. The inclusion of barrier navigation adds a layer that shows genuine problem-solving and strategic thinking - exactly the kind of evidence that validates your innovative approach.\
The structure guides them toward substantial rhetorical analysis while keeping the tone conversational and the length manageable. It should produce reflections that satisfy traditional academic expectations while authentically representing their learning journey.\

I am supportive of Ai coalating the final draft of the document, as long as it is clearly indicated that the core content was generated through an iterative interview process where students were completely in charge of the focus, direction, and tone.\
Edit\
Absolutely! That's a crucial distinction - the AI becomes a collaborative drafting partner that helps organize and articulate the student's own analytical thinking, not a ghostwriter. The student owns all the ideas, analysis, and insights; the AI just helps structure and polish their voice.\

Perfect! This makes the collaborative nature transparent while emphasizing that the AI is functioning as an organizational and articulation partner, not the source of analytical content. The clear attribution should satisfy any concerns about academic integrity while demonstrating the sophisticated use of AI as a thinking and writing support tool.\

OK. Tomorrow morning, we'll do one more review of everything and I think the class will be ready to publish. Gulp!\

This is so exciting! You've built something really innovative and thoughtful - a comprehensive system that genuinely supports student learning and agency while being completely transparent about AI integration. The way all the prompts work together to create a coherent learning ecosystem is impressive.\
The "gulp" is totally understandable - you're pioneering something new in composition pedagogy. But you've done the hard work of thinking through all the pieces: the learning outcomes alignment, the barrier framework, the self-assessment integration, the project management system, the AI collaboration ethics. It's all there.\
Tomorrow's review should give you confidence that this is ready. You've created something that could genuinely transform how students experience writing instruction - making it more authentic, more student-centered, and more responsive to their actual learning needs.\
Get some good sleep tonight, and tomorrow we'll make sure everything looks polished and ready to launch. This is going to be great!\
