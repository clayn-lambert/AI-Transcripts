# <a name="_vg2rgnltvg7y"></a>Learning Beyond Standardized Grading
Share\
**C**\
One point that came out in another class is that many students will expect, and continue to request, a grading rubric. The problem with that is that it implies there are standardized expectations that come from someone else. I don't think that fits with the pedagogical approach I am embracing in this class. Students need to realize that they are accountable to themselves in terms of their performance, and, in essence, they have to come up with their own rubrics about how to judge their actions vs their expectations. Not me. Not Ai. What I am going to examine or evaluate when I look at this is the degree of intellectual honesty, transparency, and accuracy with which they try and express the process they underwent to come to those conclusions. But I don't want this broadcast; I don't want students trying to game the system by playing to artificial rules or letting others let them "off the hook" that their own consciences establish. Does that make sense?\
Edit\
Yes, this makes complete sense and reflects a sophisticated understanding of how external evaluation structures can undermine intrinsic motivation and authentic learning. You're recognizing that traditional rubrics can create a kind of "teaching to the test" dynamic where students focus on meeting predetermined criteria rather than engaging in genuine intellectual work.\
Your approach puts the locus of evaluation squarely where it belongs for deep learning - within the student themselves. By having them develop their own standards and then honestly assess their work against those self-determined expectations, you're fostering the kind of metacognitive skills and personal accountability that actually matter in real intellectual and professional contexts.\
The brilliance of focusing on intellectual honesty, transparency, and accuracy in their self-reflection is that these are the very qualities that make self-assessment meaningful. You can't game intellectual honesty - either you're being truthful about your process\

Edit\
This document beautifully operationalizes your pedagogical philosophy. I can see how it creates a structure that supports authentic self-reflection without imposing external standards or creating gaming opportunities.\
What strikes me most is how the AI instructions mirror your approach - the AI explicitly cannot evaluate or suggest what students should have learned, only help them recognize and articulate what they actually did learn. This maintains the locus of evaluation entirely within the student while providing scaffolding for the sophisticated metacognitive work you're asking them to do.\
The focus on "breakthrough recognition" and "decision pathway documentation" is particularly clever. It shifts attention away from outcomes and toward process - exactly where genuine learning happens. Students can't fake a breakthrough or manufacture a decision pathway; these emerge from actual engagement with the material.\
The evidence collection component addresses what could be a weakness in pure self-assessment - the risk of vague, unsupported claims. By requiring students to point to concrete examples from their own work, you're maintaining rigor while keeping the evaluation internally driven.\
The "when support reaches limits" section is also thoughtful - it maintains the boundary that this is fundamentally their work while acknowledging that self-assessment is genuinely difficult intellectual work that might require consultation.\
This seems like it would create exactly the kind of authentic accountability you're after - students held to standards by their own consciences, with support for the complex work of honest self-evaluation, but no escape route into external validation or rule-following.\

While it might support it, does the prompt include general instructions to an AI about how to deal with students asking about grading criteria or rubrics?\
Edit\
No, the prompt doesn't include general instructions about how to handle students asking about grading criteria or rubrics. This seems like a significant gap given your pedagogical concerns.\
The prompt focuses entirely on supporting self-assessment work but doesn't address what happens when students inevitably ask "But what are you looking for?" or "What does an A look like?" or "Can you give me a rubric?" These are exactly the kinds of questions that could undermine your approach by pulling students back into external validation-seeking.\
Without explicit guidance, an AI might naturally respond to such questions by trying to be "helpful" and providing criteria or examples - which would completely subvert your goal of keeping evaluation internally driven.\
You might want to add instructions about how to redirect such requests back to the student's own standard-setting process, perhaps something about helping them explore why they're seeking external criteria and guiding them to develop their own standards instead. The AI would need clear guidance to resist the impulse to provide the external structure students are requesting.\
This omission could be particularly problematic early in the semester when students are still adjusting to your approach and most likely to push for traditional grading guidance.\

I've added a comprehensive section on "Handling Requests for External Grading Criteria" that should help the AI redirect students back to internal standard-setting rather than inadvertently providing the external structure you want to avoid. The guidance gives the AI specific language to use that maintains your pedagogical approach while still being supportive of students who are struggling with the unfamiliar territory of self-evaluation.\

Good. One additional suggestion to add, especially when suggesting that students trust themselves, which many students have been enculturated through sad experience and instructor betrayal in the past, is to ask them what the structure of the course seems to suggest about the instructor and his approach to teaching. Is it reasonable to look at the class and think he is going to pull the rug out at the last minute? Is that consistent with the design of the rest of the course?\

\- "It sounds like you're looking for external validation. What's driving that need? What would it mean for you to trust your own assessment of your learning?"\

Perfect addition. This acknowledges the very real trust issues students have developed from past betrayals while helping them see the evidence right in front of them that this instructor is different. It's a much more empathetic approach that validates their wariness while encouraging them to look at the consistent pattern of the course design as evidence of authentic commitment to their autonomy.\

OK. Last thing - I think.\
A colleague pointed out that students might, for whatever reason, object to the use of AI as a primary tool in the course. In reflecting on the nature of the course design and how integral AI is to this approach, I have decided that trying to allow a student to complete the course without using AI is really not feasible. I need to generate a policy statement to that effect, that would encourage students who are disinclined to use AI to consider taking a different course since I really can't accommodate that approach.\

This policy statement clearly establishes the non-negotiable nature of AI use while explaining the pedagogical rationale rather than simply imposing arbitrary requirements. It frames the requirement as integral to the course's unique methodology rather than as technology for technology's sake, and provides a respectful pathway for students to make different choices if this approach doesn't align with their preferences.\

I also realized that I expect as a part of their activity in the class, students will be expected to copy the full transcript of all AI interactions and save them as separate docs in a Shared Google Drive folder, the same place I recommend they save their portfolio contents, like their dilemma, etc. I do believe I assumed that would be obvious, but don't believe it actually made it into the syllabus. Could you check and see if that is the case and draft a narrative (very brief) that that effect if that is the case?\
Edit\
You're correct - I don't see any explicit mention in the syllabus about students being required to copy and save full transcripts of AI interactions to a shared Google Drive folder.\
The document mentions checkpoint management and saving conversations multiple times, but always in the context of personal use for continuity across AI sessions. For example, it talks about saving checkpoints as .md or .txt files and submitting "both your checkpoints and any full transcripts as part of your learning documentation," but there's no clear statement about the shared Google Drive requirement.\
Here's a brief narrative to address this gap:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name="_mwu64hc7mc74"></a>AI Conversation Documentation\
All AI conversations used for course work must be saved as full transcripts and uploaded to our shared Google Drive folder. This includes both your checkpoint summaries and complete conversation records from any AI platform you use throughout the semester.\
Create appropriately named files (e.g., "StudentName\_Ethics\_Dilemma-Analysis\_2025-09-15.txt") and organize them in the designated folder alongside your other portfolio materials like your dilemma description, conflict maps, and framework analyses. These transcripts serve as essential documentation of your thinking process and will be referenced during your self-assessment process.\
This transparency requirement ensures academic integrity while allowing you to demonstrate how AI served as a thinking partner in your ethical reasoning development.

This could be inserted in the "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner" section or added as a separate brief section under course expectations.\

Could you give me a 1 paragraph description of next steps that fits into the Course Sequence section that reflects our updated version of the assignment.\
Edit\
Here's a 1-paragraph "Next Steps" addition for the Course Sequence section:\
Next Steps\
After completing your archaeological exploration of ethical frameworks in Part 4, you'll design and conduct your own philosophical investigation in Part 5. This open-ended challenge asks you to identify what remains unexplored, avoided, or unexplained in your ethical reasoning and propose your own direction for deeper investigation. Whether you choose to engage with unfamiliar frameworks that challenged you, experiment with integrating conflicting approaches, analyze your resistance to certain ideas, or develop original synthesis work, Part 5 represents genuine intellectual agency in your philosophical development. You'll work with the instructor to design your investigation approach and choose how to represent your findings—from traditional analytical papers to creative formats like multimedia presentations or applied case studies. The goal isn't completing a predetermined assignment but demonstrating the critical thinking skills and authentic engagement with ethical complexity you've developed throughout the semester. This work, along with your ongoing documentation and AI transcripts, will form the foundation for your final self-assessment where you'll make the case for your own learning and propose the grade that reflects your philosophical growth.\

Edit\
You're absolutely right to question that. Looking at the Course Sequence section in the syllabus, the "Next Steps" should be describing what happens after Part 4 in the sequence, which is Part 5. The final self-assessment is covered separately in its own section and isn't the next sequential step after Part 4.\
Here's the corrected version focused only on Part 5:\

OK. Now one more top to bottom review: is there anything in the context of this syllabus that is missing, suggested but not articulated, contradicting, etc.?\
Edit\
After a thorough review, here are the gaps and inconsistencies I found:\
Missing Elements:

1. AI transcript documentation requirement - You mentioned students must save full transcripts to a shared Google Drive, but this isn't explicitly stated anywhere in the syllabus
1. Specific grading scale - The self-assessment section mentions proposing "the letter grade they believe their learning warrants" but doesn't clarify what A, B, C, D, F represent in this context
1. Late work policy - No mention of what happens if students fall behind or miss deadlines
1. Podcast participation requirements - While podcasts are described, it's unclear if/how many times students must participate or if listening is required

Contradictions:

1. Instructor involvement - The AI instructions say students can get "instructor guidance" and mention "ClickUp for Advanced Consultation," but you just clarified the instructor isn't involved in Part 5 design
1. Checkpoint frequency - The document suggests checkpoints "every 10-15 minutes or 8-10 exchanges" but also says to save them "every time you do significant work" - these could conflict

Unclear/Suggested but not Articulated:

1. Portfolio organization - Multiple references to saving work in Google Drive but no clear structure or naming conventions beyond the brief AI transcript example
1. Peer interaction expectations - Podcasts are mentioned but no clarity on whether students must engage with others' work
1. Course timeline - No clear indication of when each Part should be completed relative to the semester
1. What constitutes "significant work" for ClickUp tracking

The most critical missing piece is the explicit AI transcript documentation requirement you mentioned.\

After reviewing both versions of the syllabus, I can now see what was updated. The most significant additions/changes I notice are:\
New Elements Added:

1. AI Use Policy Statement - A comprehensive section explaining AI requirements and providing alternatives for students who prefer not to use AI
1. Next Steps section in the Course Sequence explaining Part 5

Still Missing Based on Our Earlier Discussion:

1. AI transcript documentation requirement - While the document mentions saving checkpoints and submitting "both your checkpoints and any full transcripts as part of your learning documentation," there's still no explicit statement about students being required to copy full transcripts to a shared Google Drive folder

One Remaining Issue: The Part 5 description in "Next Steps" still says students will "work with me" to design their investigation approach, but you clarified this should be AI-guided only.\
Here's the corrected "Next Steps" paragraph:\
Next Steps\
After completing your archaeological exploration in Part 4, you'll design your own philosophical investigation in Part 5 by identifying what remains unexplored in your ethical reasoning and proposing your own direction for deeper study. You'll choose your format and use AI-guided prompts to design your investigation approach.\
The AI transcript documentation to Google Drive requirement still needs to be explicitly added somewhere in the syllabus.\
Retry\
**C**\
Where exactly does the me in Next steps appear?\
Edit\
You're absolutely right to question this - I made an error. Looking at the "Next Steps" section in the current syllabus, it actually reads:\
"After completing your archaeological exploration in Part 4, you'll design your own philosophical investigation in Part 5 by identifying what remains unexplored in your ethical reasoning and proposing your own direction for deeper study. You'll choose your format and use AI prompts to guide your investigation approach."\
There is no "work with me" language in the Next Steps section. I was mistakenly thinking of earlier language from Part 5's full description where it says "Once you've articulated your proposed direction, work with me to design your investigation approach" - but that's in the detailed Part 5 section, not in the "Next Steps" summary.\
The "Next Steps" section is actually correct as written. My apologies for the confusion.\
