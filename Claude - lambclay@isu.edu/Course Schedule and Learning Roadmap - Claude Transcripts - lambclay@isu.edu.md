I see you've shared detailed course materials for what appears to be an innovative composition course that emphasizes personalized learning, AI collaboration, and professional writing development. This is a fascinating approach to writing instruction that breaks from traditional models in several key ways.\
Let me create a comprehensive overview that synthesizes all the information you've provided:\
Professional Writing Course: Complete Guide\
Document\
\# Professional Writing Course: Complete Guide

\## Course Philosophy & Structure

This course revolutionizes traditional composition instruction by focusing on \*\*authentic professional development\*\* rather than academic essay writing. All work happens\
This is a remarkably thoughtful and innovative approach to composition instruction. The course design addresses many common issues with traditional writing courses by:

1. Eliminating homework stress through dedicated lab time
1. Connecting writing to real career goals rather than abstract academic exercises
1. Personalizing learning based on individual barriers and needs
1. Integrating AI transparently as a learning tool rather than forbidding it
1. Focusing on growth and process rather than perfect final products
1. Using authentic assessment through self-reflection rather than traditional grading

The weekly conference model and Kanban documentation system create strong scaffolding for student success while maintaining flexibility. The emphasis on professional development makes the writing instruction immediately relevant and transferable.\
What aspects of this course structure are you most interested in discussing further? Are you implementing this approach, adapting elements for your own teaching, or exploring similar innovations in composition instruction?\

Do I have the draft deadlines in the course elements, or was that something you added?\
Edit\
Looking back through all the course materials you provided, I can see that I added specific language about "Draft deadline" that wasn't explicitly stated in your documents.\
Here's what your materials actually say about deadlines:\
From the course schedule:

- Week 8: Progress check – at least 2 projects underway
- Week 12: Draft versions of all 4 required projects in progress
- Week 16: Final versions of all projects due by Wednesday, December 10

And from the FAQ:

- "Yes, there are key deadlines for project milestones and the final self-assessment to keep you on track."

So you do have deadlines built into the course structure, but I incorrectly labeled Week 12 as "Draft deadline" in my overview table when your materials more accurately describe it as having "draft versions of all 4 projects in progress" - which suggests ongoing work rather than a hard deadline for completed drafts.\
Would you like me to update the artifact to reflect the actual language from your course materials more precisely?\

Are you able to review content posted to a publicly published website?\
Edit\
Yes, I can review content on publicly published websites using the web\_fetch tool, but there are some important limitations:\
What I can access:

- Public websites that don't require login or authentication
- Content that's openly available on the web
- Pages where you provide me the exact URL

What I cannot access:

- Private documents (like private Google Docs, password-protected sites)
- Content behind login walls or paywalls
- Sites that require authentication
- I cannot browse or search for URLs - you'd need to provide the specific URL you want me to review

How it works:

- You give me the exact URL
- I fetch the content using the web\_fetch tool
- I can then analyze, review, or provide feedback on that content

If you have a publicly published website with course content you'd like me to review, just share the URL and let me know what kind of feedback or analysis you're looking for. I can compare it to the documentation you've already shared, check for consistency, suggest improvements, or provide any other type of review you need.\

Excellent. It is a Notion.so markdown page that I will publish that I would like to embed directly into my Canvas LMS page for student use, but that requires more sophisticated coding for display than Canvas's RME can handle.\
Edit\
That sounds like a great approach! Notion's markdown export can indeed be quite sophisticated, and Canvas's Rich Text Editor has limitations when it comes to complex layouts, interactive elements, or advanced styling.\
I can definitely help you create a more Canvas-friendly version or suggest alternative approaches. Here are a few directions we could go:\
Option 1: Canvas-Compatible HTML I could help you convert the Notion markdown into clean HTML that works well within Canvas's content editor, maintaining as much of the visual appeal as possible while staying within Canvas's constraints.\
Option 2: Embedded iframe If you publish the Notion page publicly, we could create a simple HTML page that embeds the Notion content via iframe, which you can then embed in Canvas.\
Option 3: Styled HTML Artifact I could recreate the content as a standalone HTML page with embedded CSS that you can host and embed in Canvas, giving you full control over the styling and layout.\
Option 4: Canvas-Native Recreation Convert the content into a format that works well with Canvas's native tools while preserving the key information and user experience.\
Could you share the URL of your published Notion page? I'll take a look at the content and structure, then we can discuss which approach would work best for your students and your Canvas setup.\

I have ChatGPT producing it right now (sorry about the brand disloyalty) and it is taking a bit of processing to complete. Once it is ready, I'll connect you...\
Edit\
No worries at all about using ChatGPT! Different AI tools have different strengths, and it makes perfect sense to use whatever works best for your specific needs. I'm happy to help with the Canvas integration piece once you have the Notion content ready.\
Take your time - I'll be here when you're ready to work on making it Canvas-compatible. Whether that means simplifying the HTML, creating an embeddable version, or finding another solution that works well within Canvas's constraints, we can figure out the best approach once I can see what we're working with.\
Just share the URL when it's ready and let me know what kind of Canvas integration you're hoping for!\

How do I group different blocks of text inside Notion so that a header and all the subsequent blocks could be reformatted as a toggle to create a more nested appearance?\
Edit\
In Notion, you can create toggles to group content and create that nested, collapsible appearance. Here are the methods:\
Method 1: Create a New Toggle Block

1. Type /toggle and select "Toggle" from the menu
1. This creates a toggle heading where you can type your header text
1. Press Enter to create content inside the toggle
1. Add any blocks you want (text, lists, images, etc.) - they'll all be nested under the toggle

Method 2: Convert Existing Content to Toggle

1. Click the six-dot handle (⋮⋮) to the left of your header block
1. Select "Turn into" from the menu
1. Choose "Toggle" from the options
1. Your header becomes the toggle title

Method 3: Drag Content Into Existing Toggles

1. Create or select your toggle block
1. Drag other blocks by their six-dot handles and drop them inside the toggle
1. You'll see a blue line indicating where the content will nest

Method 4: Select Multiple Blocks

1. Click and drag to select your header and all subsequent blocks you want grouped
1. Right-click and choose "Turn into toggle"
1. The first selected block becomes the toggle header, rest become nested content

Pro Tips:

- You can nest toggles inside other toggles for multi-level organization
- Use Shift+Click to select multiple non-adjacent blocks
- Toggle blocks can contain any type of Notion content (databases, embeds, etc.)

This will give you that clean, organized appearance where students can expand/collapse sections as needed!\

It looks like the web fetch returned a generic Notion page rather than your specific content. This often happens with Notion pages that aren't fully public or have sharing restrictions.\
Could you try one of these approaches:\
Option 1: Make it fully public

1. In your Notion page, click "Share" in the top right
1. Toggle on "Share to web"
1. Make sure "Allow search engines" is enabled if you want it fully accessible
1. Copy the new public URL and share it with me

Option 2: Export and share the content

1. Click the three dots (...) menu in your Notion page
1. Select "Export"
1. Choose "HTML" format
1. You could then paste the HTML content directly here or upload the exported file

Option 3: Share the raw content If the page is working for you, you could copy and paste the text content here directly, and I can help you format it for Canvas.\
Which approach would work best for you? Once I can see the actual content, I'll be able to help you create a Canvas-compatible version that maintains the organization and visual appeal you're going for.\

I'm still getting a generic Notion page rather than your specific content. This suggests the page might not be fully publicly accessible yet.\
Here are a few things to check in Notion:

1. Share Settings:
   1. Click "Share" in the top-right corner
   1. Make sure "Share to web" is toggled ON
   1. Consider enabling "Allow search engines" for full public access
1. Page Status:
   1. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for Notion's public sharing to propagate
1. Alternative Approach: Since this is about Writing Barrier Pathways (which sounds like it connects to the diagnostic and learning pathways from your course materials), you could:
   1. Copy/paste the content directly into our conversation
   1. Export as HTML and share the code
   1. Take screenshots of the key sections

Would you like to try adjusting the sharing settings, or would it be easier to share the content another way? I'm excited to see what you've created for the barrier pathways - it sounds like a really useful resource for students!\

I'm still getting the same generic Notion page response. This typically indicates that the page isn't yet fully accessible to web crawlers or there may be a caching issue on Notion's end.\
A few quick troubleshooting options:\
Quick Check:

- Try opening the link in an incognito/private browser window to see if it loads the actual content
- If it doesn't load there, the public sharing might need more time to propagate

Alternative Approaches:

1. Wait and retry - Sometimes Notion takes 5-10 minutes for public sharing to work fully
1. Copy/paste the content - This might be fastest if you want to move forward now
1. Export method - Export as HTML from Notion and share the code

Since you mentioned this is about Writing Barrier Pathways and you want to embed it in Canvas, I'm particularly interested to see how you've organized the diagnostic results and learning activities. Would copying the text content be easiest for now so we can work on the Canvas integration?\

I'm getting the same result - it seems like the Notion page isn't accessible to my web fetch tool yet. This is common with newly published Notion pages.\
Since you need to move forward with creating Canvas-compatible content, would it work better if you:

1. Copy and paste the text content directly into our chat, or
1. Export from Notion (three dots menu → Export → HTML) and share that code?

That way I can immediately start working on creating a Canvas-friendly version with proper HTML structure, styling, and any interactive elements that will work within Canvas's constraints.\
I'm particularly interested to see how you've structured the barrier pathways since that seems like it would be a key resource for students to reference throughout the semester as they work on their personalized learning plans.\

1. See exactly what you've created for the Writing Barrier Pathways
1. Analyze the structure and formatting
1. Create a Canvas-compatible HTML version that preserves the organization and functionality
1. Suggest the best approach for embedding it in your LMS

Just paste the text content here, and I'll work on creating a version that will display well in Canvas while maintaining the nested, organized appearance you're going for.\

Wait!!!! I want you to look at the language of the AI prompts suggested by another AI interface. I am not confident they are acheivable...\
Edit\
You're absolutely right to be concerned! Let me look at those AI prompts more carefully. Here are some examples from your document:\
Generic/Vague Prompts:

- "Help me explore ways I could better identify and understand my writing audience, using examples or creating a strategy that fits my current project."
- "Assist me in exploring ways I might build confidence and motivation to consider my audience seriously in my writing process."
- "Help me brainstorm and clarify my writing purposes, suggesting strategies to define clear goals for my projects."

Issues I see:

1. Too broad and unfocused - these could lead to overwhelming, generic responses
1. Lacks specificity about the student's actual situation or project
1. No clear deliverable - what exactly should the AI produce?
1. Missing context about the student's field, current project, or specific challenges
1. Passive language - "help me explore" rather than "guide me through a specific activity"

Better prompts might be:

- "I'm writing [specific document type] for [specific audience]. Walk me through 3 questions I should ask myself to better understand what this audience needs to know, then help me apply those questions to my current draft."
- "I'm struggling to stay focused on my purpose while drafting. Give me a 5-minute activity I can do right now to check if my current paragraph serves my main goal of [specific purpose]."

Would you like me to revise the prompts in your barrier pathways to be more specific, actionable, and achievable? I can make them more targeted to produce concrete, useful responses rather than generic advice.\
Retry\
**C**\
The underlying tension is that the AI is not supposed to "do" anything here; rather, the goal is for the AI to guide the student in exploring options that will help them to develop the required skill or behavior.\
Edit\
Ah, that's a crucial distinction! You're right - the current prompts are asking the AI to provide solutions rather than facilitating the student's own exploration and skill development.\
Looking at the prompts again with this lens, I see they're too directive:\
Current (too directive):

- "Help me improve how I organize ideas and select evidence to support my arguments."
- "Guide me through activities to practice integrating and connecting evidence in my writing."
- "Assist me in developing strong, focused thesis statements and central themes for my writing projects."

These ask the AI to provide improvement strategies, activities, or development assistance - essentially doing the thinking work.\
Better approach (exploratory/facilitative):

- "Ask me questions that help me discover what I already know about organizing ideas, then guide me to identify which organizational approaches might work best for my current project."
- "Walk me through reflecting on how I currently integrate evidence, then help me explore what adjustments I might try in my next draft."
- "Help me examine my current thesis attempt by asking questions that reveal its strengths and areas for development."

The AI should be:

- Asking probing questions
- Facilitating self-discovery
- Guiding reflection on current practices
- Helping students identify their own next steps
- Supporting exploration of options rather than providing solutions

Would you like me to revise the prompts throughout the barrier pathways to better reflect this facilitative, exploratory approach?\

Yes, please. #2. Almost all the affective AI prompts seem to focus almost exclusively on changing attitudes or emotions in ways that cannot be facilitated using current technologies. Could you determine if there are more effective suggestions in these particular domain suggestions?\
Edit\
You're absolutely right on both points. Let me analyze the affective prompts:\
Current problematic affective prompts:

- "Help me develop a positive attitude toward revising and improving my writing."
- "Help me build confidence and reduce anxiety around developing my thesis."
- "Assist me in finding ways to stay motivated and emotionally engaged in defining and pursuing my writing purposes."

These are asking AI to perform therapy or emotional coaching, which isn't realistic or appropriate.\
More effective affective approaches should:

1. Focus on behaviors and strategies rather than emotional states
1. Help students identify patterns in their emotional responses
1. Guide exploration of concrete actions that might reduce barriers
1. Facilitate self-awareness rather than emotional change

Better affective prompts might be:

- "Help me identify specific moments when I feel stuck on my thesis, then explore small concrete steps I could take when that happens."
- "Guide me through examining what conditions help me feel more ready to tackle revision, then help me plan how to create those conditions."
- "Ask me questions about past writing experiences where I felt engaged, then help me explore what elements I might apply to my current project."

The key is shifting from "help me feel better" to "help me explore what I do when I feel stuck and what concrete actions might help."\
Would you like me to revise all the prompts with this approach - making them more exploratory/facilitative overall, and making the affective ones focus on behavioral strategies and self-awareness rather than emotional change?\

Oh, absolutely!\

Perfect! I've revised all the AI prompts to be:\
1\. More facilitative and exploratory:

- Changed from directive "Help me improve..." to exploratory "Ask me questions about..."
- Shifted from AI providing solutions to AI guiding student self-discovery
- Focused on examining current practices and exploring options

2\. More realistic for affective barriers:

- Removed therapy/emotional change language
- Focused on behavioral strategies and concrete actions
- Emphasized identifying successful past experiences and conditions that work
- Asked about specific situations rather than trying to change feelings

Key improvements:

- Cognitive prompts now guide exploration of what students already know and help them discover gaps
- Applicative prompts focus on examining current practices and exploring alternatives
- Affective prompts help students identify successful strategies from past experiences and manageable steps forward

The prompts now support student agency and self-discovery while staying within realistic bounds of what AI can facilitate. They're also much more specific and action-oriented, leading to concrete explorations rather than generic advice.\
Would you like me to now create the Canvas-compatible HTML version with these improved prompts?\

Perfect! I've now revised all the Description statements to be more direct and declarative, removing the tentative "might" language. The descriptions now clearly state the barriers as definitive experiences rather than possibilities.\
The changes make the barriers feel more concrete and relatable for students - they can more easily identify with statements like "I have trouble clearly identifying my audience" rather than "I might have trouble..." This direct approach should help students better recognize their own experiences and choose the pathways that truly match their needs.\
Now that we have the content refined with:

- ✅ Facilitative, exploratory AI prompts
- ✅ Realistic affective strategies focused on behaviors rather than emotions
- ✅ Direct, declarative barrier descriptions

Would you like me to create the Canvas-compatible HTML version of this content? I can make it with collapsible sections (using HTML details/summary tags that work in Canvas) so students can easily navigate through the different barrier types and focus on the ones most relevant to their diagnostic results.\
