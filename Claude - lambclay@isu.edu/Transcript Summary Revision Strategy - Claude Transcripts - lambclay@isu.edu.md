I've updated the summary to incorporate the key insights from the new transcript portion, particularly around AI integration and the pedagogical challenges you've been working through. The major additions include:\
AI Integration Breakthroughs:

- Recognition that AI can provide the responsive coaching that kinesthetic learners need
- Understanding that the collaborative dialogue model (like our conversation) can template productive student-AI interactions
- Identification of academic integrity tensions and the need for explicit training

Pedagogical Challenges Addressed:

- Moving beyond the "banking model" of education toward experiential, kinesthetic learning
- Balancing student freedom with necessary structure for at-risk learners
- Developing If/Then approaches that provide guidance without removing agency

Implementation Insights:

- Need for gradual release scaffolding to build self-directed learning skills
- Importance of process documentation when AI is involved
- Recognition that students require explicit training on AI as thinking partner vs. completion service

Action Items:

- Develop AI orientation materials and protocols
- Create structured choice frameworks
- Design peer mentorship systems
- Establish transparency protocols for AI collaboration

The updated summary now captures both your original course design and the evolved thinking about AI integration, student autonomy challenges, and the shift away from traditional banking model pedagogy.\
