Using the Part 1 prompt I just uploaded, could you create a simulated student response for pilot testing?\
Edit\
I'll create a realistic simulated student response that follows the structure and demonstrates the kind of authentic detail needed for effective pilot testing.\

\## Student's Initial Prompt

I've completed the Ethical Dilemma Identification proces\
This simulated response includes several authentic elements that would be valuable for pilot testing:\
Realistic dilemma complexity: The academic dishonesty scenario involves genuine competing values (integrity vs. compassion, individual vs. systemic issues) that students commonly encounter.\
Authentic constraints: The time limitations, preference for digital tools, and energy fluctuations reflect real student experiences.\
Genuine learning style details: The visual learning preference and need to "think out loud" through writing are specific enough to guide meaningful recommendations.\
Appropriate knowledge level: Shows limited ethics background while expressing genuine curiosity about frameworks and applications.\
Real concerns: Questions about privacy, maintaining momentum, and practical relevance demonstrate authentic student worries.\
This response would test whether the AI coaching can:

- Handle a complex, morally ambiguous dilemma
- Work with realistic time constraints
- Adapt to visual learning preferences
- Provide framework guidance for beginners
- Address ethical concerns about studying real situations
- Create sustainable 16-week plans

Would you like me to create additional variations (different dilemmas, learning styles, or constraint scenarios) for more comprehensive pilot testing?\

This is ideal, thank you. Using this response, could you also simulate the Part 2 results according to this prompt?\
Edit\
I'll simulate the AI coaching conversation that would result from the student's prompt, following the Part 1 instructions to create a realistic "Part 2" interaction.\

\## AI Coach Response

Thank you for sharing such a thoughtful and complex dilemma. The tension you've identified between institutional integrity and individual compassion in the face of systemic inequali\
This simulated conversation demonstrates several key elements that would be valuable for pilot testing:\
Effective AI Coaching Behaviors:

- Asks clarifying questions rather than prescribing solutions
- Builds on student preferences and constraints
- Offers multiple options with clear rationales
- Maintains appropriate boundaries around the real-world situation
- Focuses on sustainable, personalized approaches

Realistic Student Engagement:

- Shows authentic decision-making process
- Asks practical questions about implementation
- Demonstrates growing confidence and specificity
- Reveals learning preferences through interaction

Quality Exploration Plan Elements:

- Framework selection directly tied to dilemma tensions
- Documentation method matches visual learning style
- Realistic time commitments with backup strategies
- Final deliverable aligned with stated goals
- Privacy considerations appropriately addressed

Areas for Pilot Testing:

- Does the AI maintain coaching stance vs. directive approach?
- How well does it adapt to different learning styles and constraints?
- Can it guide framework selection without overwhelming beginners?
- Does it create sustainable long-term plans?
- How effectively does it handle real-world ethical boundaries?

This simulation would help identify whether the prompt successfully guides AI toward effective coaching behaviors and produces meaningful, personalized exploration plans.\

OK. This is really helpful. It appears there are some problematic instructions somewhere in Part 1 prompt because what was produced far exceeds what should be included at this stage in the student's experience, so let's break this down a little bit and find the issues.\
Edit\
You're absolutely right! Looking at what the AI produced, there are several issues where it jumped ahead too far in the process. Let me identify the problematic areas:\
Problems I can see:

1. Premature Framework Selection: The AI immediately suggested 4 specific frameworks (Care Ethics, Rawlsian Justice, etc.) with detailed timelines, when the student explicitly said they have minimal ethics background ("I know about utilitarianism from intro philosophy, but that's about it").
1. Overly Detailed Planning: The AI created a complete 16-week schedule with specific week assignments before properly exploring the student's preferences and constraints.
1. Skipped Discovery Process: The prompt says to "Ask probing questions that help the student discover what will work best for them" but the AI moved quickly to providing solutions rather than facilitating discovery.
1. Assumed Too Much Knowledge: The AI used technical ethics terminology without checking if the student understood these concepts.
1. Rushed the Conversation Flow: The prompt lists a 7-step conversation flow, but the AI compressed multiple steps into single responses.

Specific prompt language that might be causing issues:

- The "Common Exploration Approaches - Examples" section might be prompting the AI to jump to solutions too quickly
- The framework application strategy section assumes students already know which frameworks to choose
- The conversation flow might need more explicit pacing instructions

Which of these issues do you see as most problematic? And are there other problems I'm missing that you'd like me to focus on?\
