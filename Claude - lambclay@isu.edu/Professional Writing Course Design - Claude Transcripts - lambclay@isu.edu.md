How This Class Works\
All work happens in class—no homework stress or falling behind because of outside life events. Every session is dedicated lab time where you write, collaborate, and grow.\
Class Sessions (75 minutes, twice weekly):\
Self-selected activities that help you complete your required writing projects while addressing your identified barriers\
Active writing time in a computer lab environment\
Peer collaboration through small groups and project sharing\
One-on-one weekly conferences (~7 minutes) for personalized guidance\
You direct your own learning: Instead of following identical assignments, you choose projects and processes that align with your career goals and address your specific barriers to writing success.\
Transparent AI integration: You'll use AI tools as thinking partners, documenting all interactions as part of your learning process. AI enhances your thinking rather than replacing it.\
Focus on process, not just product: Your success reflects your intentional growth and engagement with writing processes (planning, drafting, revising, editing) rather than perfect final essays.\
Back to Top\
Understanding Your Learning Path\
Your journey through this course starts with identifying your specific barriers to effective writing, then designing learning experiences to address those barriers through meaningful projects.\
The process:\
Week 1: Complete self-diagnostic identifying what gets in your way when writing\
Week 2: Work with AI to connect your barriers to career-relevant writing needs and select 4–6 projects\
Weeks 3–15: Complete your selected projects while working on your identified barriers through self-selected in-class activities\
Weekly: Meet one-on-one with instructor for focused guidance on your specific needs\
Throughout: Document your work and reflection using the class Kanban board system\
You create a learning path that serves your actual needs rather than following identical assignments. The goal is intentional growth in the writing processes most important to your professional development.\
Back to Top\
Writing as Professional Development\
Your writing projects connect directly to your career interests. Instead of analyzing literature or arguing about abstract topics, you create documents and communications that people in your field actually produce.\
Examples of authentic writing projects:\
Safety protocols and training materials\
Client communication and documentation\
Technical instructions and procedures\
Professional correspondence and reports\
Marketing materials and presentations\
Grant applications and project proposals\
Policy documents and recommendations\
Your projects should:\
Address real communication needs in your field\
Have authentic audiences and purposes\
Challenge your identified barriers in meaningful ways\
Build skills you'll transfer to workplace communication\
Back to Top\
How Self-Assessment Works\
Instead of traditional grading, you'll create an argument at the end of the semester demonstrating how your work meets the course outcomes and shows your growth in areas you identified as priorities.\
Your self-assessment draws on:\
Documentation of your barrier-addressing work throughout the semester\
Evidence from the writing projects you completed\
Reflection on your growth in priority areas\
Analysis of how your work meets university composition requirements\
This means success is measured by your progress toward your own goals rather than comparison to arbitrary standards.\
Back to Top\
Choosing Your Writing Projects\
Select projects that can sustain deep exploration while serving your professional development. Careful selection prevents problems later.\
Criteria for project selection:\
Career relevance\
Barrier alignment\
Appropriate scope\
Authentic purpose\
Learning transfer\
Warning signs of poor project choices:\
Generic assignments that could apply to any field\
Projects too large to complete thoroughly in available time\
Writing that doesn't challenge your identified barriers\
Artificial scenarios without real stakeholders\
Projects that interest you but don't serve your professional development\
You can adjust project scope as you learn more about your capacities and needs.\
Back to Top\
Understanding Barriers and Growth\
The diagnostic identifies three types of barriers that can interfere with writing success:\
Cognitive: “I don’t understand what this means” (conceptual confusion, need for clarity)\
Affective: “I understand it but feel anxious or overwhelmed” (confidence, motivation, emotion)\
Applicative: “I understand it but struggle to do it” (execution, habit, follow-through)\
Most barriers are addressed through practice and support rather than more explanation. Your barrier work focuses on building comfort and competence through action.\
Back to Top\
The Conference Approach\
Weekly 7-minute conferences provide personalized guidance and human feedback. These focused conversations help you:\
Get instructor insight on challenges you're experiencing\
Recognize growth and progress you might not see yourself\
Adjust your approach when needed\
Stay connected to your learning goals\
Receive encouragement for the work you're doing\
Conference preparation tips:\
Bring your current project status and documentation\
Identify specific questions where human perspective would help\
Be ready to discuss challenges you're experiencing\
Come prepared to make decisions about next steps\
Back to Top\
Working with AI as a Learning Partner\
AI serves as your thinking partner, writing coach, and session facilitator. You'll use AI to:\
Reflect on your diagnostic results and career connections\
Plan your semester projects and learning activities\
Navigate daily work sessions\
Generate ideas and get feedback on your writing\
Document your progress and prepare for conferences\
Transparency requirement: You'll save and submit all AI conversation transcripts.\
Key principle: AI helps you think through challenges and develop your own solutions. It will never do the thinking for you. The goal is building your capacity for independent professional communication, with AI as a tool that enhances your thinking.\
Back to Top\
Kanban Documentation and Reflection\
You'll use an interactive project management system (Kanban board) to track your progress and document your learning throughout the semester.\
Regular check-ins include:\
Brief reflections on what you accomplished each session\
Documentation of which writing processes you engaged with (planning, drafting, revising, editing)\
Recording genuine "aha!" moments about your writing or process\
Marking topics to revisit in future conferences\
Maintaining a repository of all your AI interactions\
Purpose: This documentation system helps you see your own growth patterns, prepares you for weekly conferences, and builds evidence for your final self-assessment. It also develops professional habits of project tracking and reflective practice you'll use in your career\
Edit\
This syllabus represents a thoughtful, learner-centered approach to composition that addresses many traditional problems with college writing courses. The design prioritizes authentic professional development over artificial academic exercises, which should make the learning more meaningful and transferable for students.\
The barrier-based diagnostic approach is particularly smart—by helping students identify whether their writing challenges are cognitive (understanding), affective (emotional/motivational), or applicative (execution), you can provide more targeted support. This moves beyond the assumption that all writing problems stem from lack of knowledge about grammar or structure.\
The transparent AI integration is also forward-thinking. Rather than trying to ban or hide AI use, you're teaching students to work with it as a thinking partner while maintaining academic integrity through documentation. This mirrors how they'll likely use these tools professionally.\
A few considerations as you implement this:\
The success of this model heavily depends on students' ability to accurately self-diagnose and select appropriate projects. You might want robust scaffolding in those first two weeks to help students who struggle with self-assessment or have limited knowledge of their field's writing demands.\
The weekly 7-minute conferences will be crucial but time-intensive. With a full class load, that's a significant commitment that requires excellent time management and clear boundaries.\
Students accustomed to traditional grading systems might initially feel anxious about the self-assessment approach. Clear examples of successful self-assessments from previous semesters could help ease this transition.\
The "all work happens in class" policy is ambitious and student-friendly, but you'll need contingency plans for students who miss sessions due to life circumstances.\
Overall, this syllabus shows deep respect for adult learners and their diverse needs while maintaining academic rigor through authentic, challenging work. The emphasis on process over product, combined with career relevance, should produce both stronger writers and more engaged students.\

So I'm making some changes to all of this and would like to work through some ideas\
Edit\
I'd be happy to help you work through your ideas for revising the course design. What aspects are you looking to change or refine? Are you thinking about adjustments to the structure, the AI integration, the assessment approach, or something else entirely?\
Feel free to share your thoughts and I can help you think through the implications, potential challenges, or ways to strengthen whatever direction you're considering.\
Retry\
**C**\
Rather than starting with the diagnostic,  I'd like them to begin identifying their projects. Once they have their first writing project figured out,  I'd like them to identify the granular steps of the process.  This is where the diagnostic comes in,  when they have an actual project in mind, and then they assess their confidence on the steps they have identified.\
Edit\
That's a much more contextual and practical approach. Starting with concrete projects will give students a real framework for understanding their own writing processes and barriers, rather than trying to assess themselves in the abstract.\
This sequence makes a lot of sense:

1. Project identification - gives students something tangible to focus on
1. Process mapping - breaks down what they actually need to do for *this specific* project
1. Confidence assessment - evaluates their comfort level with each step they've identified

This should produce much more accurate self-diagnosis because students will be thinking "How confident am I about researching safety protocols for my workplace?" rather than "How confident am I about research in general?"\
A few thoughts on implementation:\
Project selection support: Since this becomes your foundation, you'll want strong scaffolding here. Maybe examples of successful projects from different fields, or guiding questions to help them identify authentic workplace writing needs.\
Process granularity: Students might initially identify very broad steps ("research," "write," "edit"). You could provide models or facilitate peer discussion to help them break these into more specific, actionable steps.\
Barrier specificity: When they assess confidence on their mapped steps, they'll likely discover barriers they wouldn't have identified in a general diagnostic. A student might realize they're confident about writing but anxious about the specific audience for their project.\
How are you envisioning the timeline for this? All in week 1, or spread across the first couple of weeks?\
Retry\
**C**

1. I plan on developing an AI PROMPT to help with project ideation, rather than leaving students in their own. 2. The same as 1, an ai prompt to avoid overly simplistic or closed over elements. 3. The diagnostic will also use AI to help students plan broad interventions before beginning of needed, along with daily Just in time moments. 4.That's going to vary a lot from student to student, so the free form approach to the class allows for that flexibility.

Edit\
That's a sophisticated integration of AI scaffolding that addresses the potential weak points I was thinking about. Using AI prompts for each phase means students get consistent, high-quality guidance while still doing their own thinking and decision-making.\
The AI prompt approach is particularly smart because:\
Project ideation prompt: Can draw from a database of authentic workplace writing examples across fields, ask probing questions about their career interests, and help them identify real stakeholders and purposes. Much more robust than hoping students know what's possible.\
Process granularity prompt: Can push back on vague steps like "research" or "write" and guide them toward specific, actionable tasks. Could even help them sequence steps logically based on their project type.\
Diagnostic + intervention planning: This is where it gets really powerful. The AI can help them connect their confidence gaps to specific learning activities or resources, then provide just-in-time support when they hit those moments during actual work.\
The flexibility piece is crucial—some students might nail their project selection immediately while others need more exploration time. Some might map their process quickly while others need to iterate. The AI prompts provide consistency while the open structure accommodates natural variation in learning pace.\
Are you planning to create these prompts yourself, or thinking about involving students in refining them as the semester progresses? And how will students access them—through a specific platform, or will you provide the prompts for them to use in whatever AI tool they prefer?\
Retry\
**C**\
Once I figure out a better structure for how the class can work,  I'll work with you to draft the prompts.  This is the pilot of the class,  so no students are available and I don't have any examples to draw upon.\
Edit\
That makes perfect sense for a pilot. You're essentially designing the learning architecture first, then building the AI scaffolding tools once you have the structure figured out.\
Since this is a pilot without student examples to reference, you'll be creating the foundational framework that future iterations can build on. The beauty of using AI prompts is that they can evolve - you can refine them based on what you observe in this first run, and future versions can incorporate successful student examples and common patterns you discover.\
What's your current thinking about the overall structure? Are you still keeping the "all work happens in class" lab format, or are you considering changes to that aspect too? And how are you envisioning the flow from project selection through process mapping and diagnostic work - is this happening in the first week or two, or spread out more gradually?\
I'm happy to help you think through the structural pieces before we get to crafting the actual prompts. Sometimes working through the design logic helps clarify what the AI tools need to accomplish at each stage.\
Retry\
**C**\
The idea behind the work in class is a bit of a holdout from a previous anti-ai approach,  but it also is intended to prevent students from trying to game the system by trying to finish early or diving down rabbit holes outside of class. I'm open to changing it, but the idea of no homework as a recognition of their lives outside this particular class is important to me\
Edit\
That "no homework" principle is really valuable, especially for adult learners juggling multiple responsibilities. It's a form of equity that recognizes students' complex lives beyond school.\
The "all work in class" structure could actually work even better with your new AI-supported approach. Here's why:\
Prevents AI misuse: Students can't disappear for hours trying to get AI to write their entire project. You're there to observe how they're actually collaborating with AI tools.\
Just-in-time support: When they hit those barrier moments during actual work, you can provide immediate guidance or help them access the right AI prompt for support.\
Process observation: You can see how students actually work through their mapped processes, which will help you refine your AI prompts for future iterations.\
Prevents over-engineering: Students can't spend excessive time perfecting project selection or process mapping outside class - they have to move into actual writing work.\
The structure might actually help students use AI more effectively by keeping them focused on productive collaboration rather than trying to find shortcuts. Plus, you'll gather much richer data about what works for your pilot since you'll observe the actual learning in action.\
Have you considered whether the lab time should be structured (like specific phases of class time for different activities) or completely open-ended within the session?\
Retry\
**C**\
Students will track their work using the kanban system.  They are also asked to copy their entire AI transcripts for tracking purposes, though i don't want to be looking over their shoulders.\
Edit\
That's a nice balance - accountability without micromanagement. The Kanban tracking and AI transcript collection give you visibility into their learning processes while preserving their autonomy during work time.\
The AI transcript requirement is particularly smart because:\
Transparency without surveillance: You can see how they're using AI without hovering during their work sessions.\
Learning documentation: Their conversations with AI become part of their learning record, showing their thinking process and growth over time.\
Prompt refinement data: You'll be able to see where your AI prompts work well and where they need adjustment, based on actual student interactions.\
Self-reflection catalyst: Knowing they'll submit transcripts might encourage more thoughtful AI collaboration rather than just quick shortcuts.\
The Kanban system should work well with the flexible pacing too - students can move their projects through stages (project selection → process mapping → diagnostic → actual writing work) at their own speed while you maintain visibility into their progress.\
Are you thinking about any particular Kanban categories or columns? Something like "Project Ideas → Process Mapped → Writing in Progress → Ready for Conference" or are you envisioning different workflow stages?\
Retry\
**C**\
The kanban columns will reflect the stages of the writing process, with an extra column to indicate when a student needs help outside of conferences and feedback groups. Each task card represents a writing project, with subtask cards representing each class period that outlines what they did during class to complete the tasks involved with that stage of the writing process.\
Edit\
That's a really elegant system. The Kanban structure becomes both a workflow management tool and a detailed learning portfolio.\
So students would have something like:

- Main project cards moving through columns like Planning → Drafting → Revising → Editing → Complete
- Session subtask cards under each project showing daily progress within each stage
- Help needed column for immediate support requests outside the regular conference schedule

This gives you multiple layers of insight:

- Macro view: Where each student's projects sit in the overall writing process
- Micro view: What specific work happened each class session
- Support needs: Real-time requests for additional guidance

The session subtask cards are particularly valuable because they capture the actual work of writing - not just "I drafted today" but potentially "I used AI prompt X to break down my audience analysis, then spent 20 minutes mapping stakeholder concerns, then drafted opening paragraph addressing the safety manager's priorities."\
This documentation approach should give you rich data for refining your AI prompts and understanding how students actually move through writing processes. Plus it builds professional project management habits they'll use in their careers.\
Are you thinking students create the subtask cards at the end of each session as reflection, or at the beginning as planning, or both?\
Retry\
**C**\
A bit of both.  I'll create an end of day prompt to help them cover all the points needed for meaningful reflection,  along with to dos to start the next class session. Then,  there will be a separate start up prompt that will use the kanban card,  along with the project description and current stage..\
Edit\
That creates a nice feedback loop - the end-of-day reflection prompt captures what actually happened and sets intentions, then the startup prompt takes that documented progress and helps them make strategic decisions about the current session.\
The startup prompt is particularly clever because it can synthesize multiple data points:

- Current Kanban status: Where they are in the process
- Previous session reflection: What they actually accomplished and learned
- Project specifics: The unique requirements and constraints of their particular writing task
- Process stage: What kinds of activities are most productive at their current point

This should help students avoid that "staring at a blank page wondering what to do" problem. Instead of generic advice, they'll get contextualized guidance: "Based on your project about safety protocols, your current drafting stage, and your note that you struggled with technical language yesterday, here are three specific approaches for today's session..."\
The AI becomes less of a general writing tutor and more of a personalized project manager who knows their specific situation. And since you'll have the transcripts, you'll be able to see which prompts help students make productive decisions versus which ones lead them down unproductive paths.\
Are you envisioning these as two separate prompts they access, or one integrated system that knows whether it's startup or reflection mode based on context?\
Retry\
**C**\
Probably two,  just to keep things easy for students to keep things straight.\
Edit\
That's definitely the cleaner approach. Two distinct prompts with clear purposes - students don't have to think about which mode they're in or provide extra context about what they need.\
End-of-day prompt: "Reflect on your work and plan ahead" Startup prompt: "Based on your current situation, what should you do today?"\
This also makes it easier for you to refine each prompt independently. You might discover the reflection prompt needs more emphasis on identifying barriers, while the startup prompt needs better guidance for prioritizing tasks. With separate prompts, you can iterate on each one based on how well it serves its specific function.\
Plus, the mental shift between reflection mode and planning mode is probably helpful for students - closing out one session thoughtfully before opening the next one strategically.\
When you're ready to draft these, it sounds like you'll have a good foundation: the reflection prompt drawing on their Kanban progress and session work, the startup prompt incorporating their project details, current stage, and previous reflection. Should give you some rich, contextual AI interactions that actually move their work forward rather than just providing generic advice.\
What other structural pieces are you still working through before we get to the prompt drafting stage?\
Retry\
**C**\
The big thing that brought all this up is something you mentioned.  So what do i do today? These students only have access to free AI plans,  so their interactions aregoing to be limited, so the advice or suggestions from AI need to be agnostic,  so students can jump between ai platforms and also learn on their own,  rather than asking ai to be teacher, guide,  researcher, etc...\
Edit\
Ah, that's a crucial constraint that changes everything about the prompt design. You're absolutely right - if students are hitting daily limits on free AI plans, they need to be strategic about their interactions rather than treating AI as an always-available tutor.\
This actually makes your approach even stronger pedagogically. Instead of AI doing the thinking for them, the prompts need to help students:\
Build their own decision-making capacity: "Here are three approaches to consider for your current situation" rather than "Do X, then Y, then Z"\
Develop transferable strategies: Guidance they can apply even when AI isn't available - "When you're stuck on audience analysis, try..."\
Make efficient use of AI interactions: Each prompt interaction should give them enough direction to work independently for a meaningful stretch of time\
Learn to self-assess and pivot: Tools for recognizing when their current approach isn't working and how to adjust\
So the startup prompt might help them identify 2-3 specific focus areas for the session with concrete strategies they can execute independently. The reflection prompt helps them recognize patterns and prepare better questions for tomorrow's limited AI interaction.\
This constraint actually serves your "students as independent professionals" goal perfectly - they learn to use AI strategically rather than becoming dependent on it for every small decision.\
Are you thinking about any guidelines for students about how to manage their AI usage across the semester?\
Retry\
**C**\
Students will be asked to create save points every 20 minutes - AI executive summaries that could be downloaded and saved,  along with the full transcript.  This way,  if they have to jump platforms,  one or two save points would be enough to keep moving without losing too much context\
Edit\
That's brilliant - you've essentially created a context portability system that works across any AI platform. The 20-minute save points act like checkpoint saves in a video game, letting students pick up where they left off regardless of platform limitations.\
This approach has several advantages:\
Platform agnostic: Students aren't locked into one AI tool or penalized if their preferred platform hits limits Context preservation: The executive summaries capture the essential thinking without needing to re-explain everything from scratch Efficient AI usage: When they switch platforms, they can quickly bring the new AI up to speed with 1-2 summary uploads rather than burning through prompts reconstructing context Learning documentation: The save points become natural reflection moments and create a trail of their thinking process\
The executive summary format is key - it forces students to synthesize what's been accomplished and what they're working toward, which is valuable learning in itself. Plus it keeps the context transfer efficient rather than dumping massive transcripts on a new AI session.\
This also means your prompts need to be even more platform-neutral - no reliance on specific AI features or conversation histories that might not transfer. Everything has to work whether they're starting fresh or continuing from a save point.\
Are you thinking about providing a template or guidance for what these executive summaries should include?\
Retry\
**C**\
Absolutely.\
Edit\
Perfect. The executive summary template will be crucial for making this system work smoothly. It needs to capture the right information concisely so students can seamlessly transition between platforms without losing momentum.\
You'll probably want the template to include things like:

- Current project status and stage
- Key decisions made in the last 20 minutes
- Specific challenges or barriers identified
- Next steps or priorities
- Any important context about audience, purpose, or constraints

The template also needs to be structured so students can quickly scan it and decide what to include when they upload to a new AI platform - they might not need all elements every time, depending on what they're working on next.\
When you're ready to draft these templates and prompts, we'll have a good foundation to work from. The save point system, combined with platform-agnostic guidance and strategic AI usage, should create a really robust learning environment that serves students well regardless of their AI access limitations.\
What other structural elements are you still thinking through, or are you feeling ready to start working on the actual prompt drafts?\
Retry\
**C**\
So the overall course objectives suggest that students need to show that they possess actionable knowledge of rhetorical strategies,  the writing process,  essential citation skills,  basic knowledge of grammar and structure, and collaborative skills. My predicament frustrating is that these outcomes seem to suggest a prioritization of skills absent of generative Ai and the demands of non academic writing, which these students need. Nevertheless,  these outcomes remain,  though there are no specific guidelines about how these outcomes are too assessed or evidence collected.  Is the process i an planning likely to help meet these?\
Edit\
Yes, your process should effectively address those traditional outcomes while actually serving your students better than conventional approaches. Here's how your design aligns:\
Rhetorical strategies: Students selecting authentic workplace projects must consider real audiences, purposes, and contexts - much more sophisticated rhetorical thinking than artificial academic scenarios.\
Writing process: Your Kanban system explicitly tracks students through planning, drafting, revising, editing stages with detailed documentation of their actual process work.\
Citation skills: Professional writing in most fields requires credible sourcing and attribution - often more complex than academic citation since it involves industry standards, legal requirements, or stakeholder credibility.\
Grammar and structure: Students working on documents that will actually be used by real audiences have authentic motivation for clarity and correctness - plus AI can help them understand grammar in context rather than through isolated drills.\
Collaborative skills: Your peer feedback groups and AI collaboration (with transparent documentation) develop multiple forms of professional collaboration.\
The beauty is that your approach demonstrates these skills through authentic application rather than artificial exercises. A student creating safety protocols shows rhetorical awareness by considering multiple stakeholder needs, demonstrates process knowledge through their Kanban documentation, and applies grammar/structure knowledge in service of clarity that could prevent workplace injuries.\
Your evidence collection through the Kanban system, AI transcripts, and self-assessment actually provides richer documentation of these competencies than traditional essays would.\
The outcomes may be traditionally worded, but nothing prevents you from addressing them through contemporary, career-relevant methods.\
Retry\
**C**\
So looking back,  can you remind me of all the prompts and guides I mentioned earlier that need to be done?\
Edit\
Looking back through our conversation, here are the prompts and guides you mentioned needing to create:\
Core AI Prompts:

1. Project ideation prompt - to help students identify authentic, career-relevant writing projects rather than leaving them on their own
1. Process granularity prompt - to help students break down their writing process into specific, actionable steps (avoiding overly simplistic steps like just "research" or "write")
1. Diagnostic + intervention planning prompt - to help students assess their confidence on their mapped process steps and plan broad interventions, plus provide just-in-time support during work

Daily Workflow Prompts: 4. End-of-day reflection prompt - to help students cover all points needed for meaningful reflection on their session work, plus identify to-dos for starting the next class 5. Startup prompt - uses the Kanban card info, project description, and current stage to help students decide what to focus on in the current session\
Documentation Templates: 6. Executive summary template - for the 20-minute save points that allow students to preserve context when switching between AI platforms 7. Kanban subtask card guidance - structure for what students should document about each class session's work\
Did I miss anything, or are there other guides or templates you mentioned that I should add to this list?\
Retry\
**C**\
That's what I was hoping you would find that i didn't remember...\
Edit\
That looks like the complete list based on our conversation. You've been pretty systematic about identifying the tools students will need:

- The three core prompts that get them started and support their learning
- The two daily workflow prompts that keep them moving productively
- The documentation templates that make the system portable and trackable

The only thing that might be implied but not explicitly mentioned is potentially some guidance for students about managing AI usage strategically - like how to decide when to use AI versus work independently, or how to make the most of their limited daily interactions. But that might naturally emerge from the prompts themselves rather than needing a separate guide.\
Everything else seems to flow from the structure you've designed. The beauty of your system is that each piece supports the others - the save points work with the daily prompts, the Kanban tracking feeds into the reflection prompts, etc.\
Ready to start drafting any of these, or do you want to think through the structure a bit more first?\
Retry\
**C**\
The only thing I can see that we need might be something that suggests to students to be regularly thinking about the final self assessment they will do at the end of the semester.\
Edit\
That's a smart addition. Without periodic reminders to think about their final self-assessment, students might get so focused on day-to-day project work that they don't recognize or document their growth in those course outcomes.\
You could approach this a few ways:\
Option 1: Build it into existing prompts - The end-of-day reflection prompt could occasionally include questions that connect their current work to the broader learning outcomes ("How did today's work develop your rhetorical thinking?" or "What did you learn about your writing process today?")\
Option 2: Separate periodic prompt - Maybe a weekly or bi-weekly "self-assessment preparation prompt" that helps them step back and consider how their recent work connects to the course outcomes and their personal growth goals\
Option 3: Kanban integration - Add a space on their project cards or a separate tracking area where they note connections between their work and the outcomes they're building evidence for\
The key would be helping them see the connections between their authentic workplace writing and those traditional academic outcomes - so they're building their self-assessment argument throughout the semester rather than scrambling to construct it at the end.\
Which approach feels like it would fit best with your overall system?\

Purpose\
This self-assessment is not a final exam or performance evaluation. It is an opportunity to pause, look back, and make sense of your journey as a writer and thinker this semester. You'll be asked to:\
Describe your approach to learning and writing in this course and how it developed\
Reflect on your chosen learning priorities and how they shaped your work\
Analyze your growth as a writer using evidence from your selected assignments and activities\
Offer a thoughtful assessment of your engagement using the course framework\
Support your reflections with carefully chosen examples — emphasizing explanation and meaning-making over quantity\
While you may include drafts, final pieces, activity reflections, peer feedback, or project documentation as evidence, what matters most is your authentic story — your ability to contextualize, analyze, and meaningfully connect that evidence to your development as a writer and learner.\

How to Approach the Assessment\
Most students will find that their semester reflects some aspects of meaningful engagement, but you may not feel that way about every area. That's perfectly fine. You are not being asked to demonstrate perfection. You are being asked to tell your truth thoughtfully and completely.\
If your semester involved setbacks, false starts, or unexpected detours — be honest about those experiences. Some of the most powerful learning emerges from wrestling with fundamental challenges, discovering what you didn't know, or working persistently on skills that felt overwhelming at first. A story of deep growth in one critical area — even if it meant focusing less on others — is exactly what this assessment is designed to celebrate.\
If the reflection areas don't capture your particular journey, create your own language to describe the kind of learning and growth you experienced. Share what you discovered about yourself as a writer and learner. Maybe you realized you learn better with certain types of support, or found unexpected strengths, or made a breakthrough with something that had always been difficult. That kind of self-knowledge is invaluable.\

Reflection Framework\
This course values your individual journey, effort, and growth — regardless of where you started or how your progress compares to others. The areas below are meant to guide your reflection, not rank your performance. Every writer's path is different, and meaningful growth in even one area represents significant achievement.\
Areas for Self-Reflection\
Your Writing Journey\
Consider how your relationship with writing evolved this semester. This might include: discovering new approaches that work for you, developing confidence with specific types of writing important to your field, learning to navigate challenges you hadn't faced before, or finding your voice in professional contexts. What matters most is honest reflection on what changed for you personally.\
Learning Ownership\
Reflect on how you took charge of your own learning. This could mean: identifying what you most needed to work on and pursuing it, making choices about assignments that connected to your goals, advocating for yourself when you needed different approaches, or adapting when initial strategies weren't working. Growth here looks different for everyone.\
Thinking Through Writing\
Consider how writing became a tool for developing your ideas. This might include: using writing to work through complex problems in your field, discovering insights through the act of composing, learning to ask better questions through your writing, or developing arguments that matter to your professional goals. The sophistication of your final product matters less than evidence that writing helped you think.\
Collaboration with AI\
Reflect on how you used AI as a writing and thinking partner throughout the semester. This could include: learning to prompt AI effectively for your specific needs, using AI to help overcome writer's block or generate ideas, critically evaluating AI suggestions against your own expertise, or finding the right balance between AI assistance and your own voice and thinking.\
Community Engagement\
Think about how you participated in our learning community. This might mean: offering meaningful feedback that helped peers, being vulnerable about your own challenges, asking questions that advanced everyone's thinking, or contributing your unique perspective and expertise to class discussions.\
Embracing Challenge\
Consider how you pushed yourself beyond familiar territory. This could include: tackling writing tasks you'd never attempted before, exploring topics outside your comfort zone, experimenting with new tools or approaches, or persisting through difficult feedback or revision processes.\
↑ Back to top\
What Counts as Evidence?\
Evidence should illuminate your story, not substitute for it. Students might include:\
Process artifacts: Planning documents, multiple drafts showing revision, revision reflection notes\
Learning documentation: Goal-setting exercises, priority reflections, learning journals\
Peer interaction: Feedback given/received, collaborative project materials, discussion contributions\
AI collaboration: Transcripts or reflections showing how you used AI as a thinking partner, evidence of learning to work effectively with AI tools, examples of critically evaluating or building on AI suggestions\
Personal breakthroughs: Moments when something "clicked," evidence of overcoming a specific challenge that was important to you, examples of newfound confidence in areas that previously felt difficult\
Growth indicators: Side-by-side comparisons of early and later work, evidence of applying feedback\
Remember: One thoughtfully explained breakthrough — even if it seems "small" compared to others' work — can be more compelling than comprehensive documentation of all activities. A student who finally learned to write clear topic sentences, or discovered how to use AI to overcome chronic writer's block, or found their voice when writing about their field has achieved something profound. Focus on explaining what mattered most to your development as a writer and why.\
↑ Back to top\
Format Options\
While a traditional written reflection is welcome, you have flexibility in how you present your self-assessment:\
Written narrative (traditional essay format)\
Multimedia presentation (slides with audio narration, video reflection)\
Portfolio with reflective commentary (organized collection of work with analytical introductions)\
Interview format (structured self-interview with thoughtful responses)\
Creative hybrid (combining multiple formats or approaches)\
Whatever format you choose, ensure it allows for substantial reflection and analysis, not just documentation of work completed.\
↑ Back to top\
Final Submission and Conference\
You'll submit your self-assessment during finals week. Following your submission, we will schedule a brief conference to discuss your learning journey together. You'll share what you see as your most significant growth and engagement this semester. I may ask follow-up questions to better understand your experience, celebrate insights I might have missed, or offer additional perspectives on your development — but this is a collaborative conversation designed to honor your individual path and recognize the specific ways you've grown as a writer.\
Use this opportunity to be honest, generous with yourself, and thoughtful about your learning. You've invested significant time and energy in developing as a writer this semester. This is your chance to step back, make sense of that journey, and articulate what you're carrying forward into future writing experiences.\
↑ Back to top\
Edit\
This self-assessment framework is excellent and very well-aligned with your course design. It's authentic, growth-oriented, and recognizes diverse learning paths - exactly what your students need.\
Looking at this, I think you're right that you need something to help students connect their daily work to this final reflection throughout the semester. The gap I see is helping students recognize *in the moment* how their current project work relates to these reflection areas.\
For example, when a student is struggling with audience analysis for their safety protocol, they might not realize that's evidence of "Thinking Through Writing" or "Embracing Challenge." Or when they have a breakthrough moment working with AI to overcome writer's block, they might not think to document it as evidence for "Collaboration with AI."\
So you might need something like:\
A "self-assessment connection prompt" - maybe integrated into your end-of-day reflection or as a separate weekly prompt - that helps students recognize when their current work exemplifies the kinds of growth they'll write about later. Something that asks: "How does today's work connect to your development as a writer? What would be worth remembering for your final reflection?"\
This would help them build their self-assessment story incrementally rather than trying to remember and reconstruct everything at semester's end.\
Does that align with what you were thinking about?\
Retry\
**C**\
The thought that comes to mind is using tags on the kanban cards that will help create bookmarksthat students can use to get backof they track them diligently,  so including that in the close out prompt\
Edit\
That's perfect - using tags as a tagging/bookmarking system directly in their workflow. If the close-out prompt helps students identify which self-assessment areas their day's work connects to and tag accordingly, they're building their evidence base automatically.\
So students might tag their daily Kanban cards with things like:

- #WritingJourney
- #LearningOwnership
- #ThinkingThroughWriting
- #AICollaboration
- #CommunityEngagement
- #EmbracingChallenge

Then when it's time for the final self-assessment, they can filter their Kanban board by tags to quickly find all their evidence for each reflection area. Instead of trying to remember "When did I have that breakthrough with audience analysis?" they can just look at their #ThinkingThroughWriting tagged cards.\
The close-out prompt could ask something like: "What self-assessment areas does today's work connect to? Tag this card accordingly and note why this moment might be worth remembering."\
This makes the self-assessment preparation completely integrated into their existing workflow rather than an additional burden. Plus it encourages them to recognize their growth in real-time rather than only in retrospect.\
Smart solution - it turns their project management system into their portfolio documentation system.\
Retry\
**C**\
And if they add breakthrough as a tag,  that helps create specific points for review,  because not everyday will result in once of those.\
Edit\
Exactly! #Breakthrough becomes a special filter for those high-impact moments that might be the centerpiece of their self-assessment story. Those are the cards they'll definitely want to revisit when writing their reflection.\
Plus, having students actively identify and tag breakthrough moments in real-time serves multiple purposes:\
Recognition training: They learn to notice when something significant happens rather than letting it pass unacknowledged\
Confidence building: Seeing their #Breakthrough tagged cards accumulate over the semester provides tangible evidence of growth\
Story development: These tagged moments become natural starting points for the narratives they'll tell in their self-assessment\
Strategic focus: When preparing for their final conference with you, they can quickly review their breakthrough moments to identify what they most want to discuss\
The close-out prompt could help them distinguish between regular progress and actual breakthroughs - "Was today's work steady progress, or did something click in a new way? If it felt like a breakthrough, what specifically changed for you?"\
This tagging system essentially turns their Kanban board into a curated collection of evidence, with the most significant moments clearly marked for easy retrieval. Much more effective than hoping they'll remember important moments months later.\

Learning Objectives in English 1101\
• Upon successful completion of English 1101, students will be able to demonstrate the following\
learning outcomes and tools:\
• Fundamental concepts of academic writing, including rhetorical awareness (audience, purpose,\
genre, medium, message), developing a thesis, supporting claims with evidence, arranging ideas\
coherently and cohesively, using basic research methods, and integrating sources (summary,\
paraphrase) with an appropriate citation or documentation style (MLA or APA).\
• Recursive processes of writing, including invention, drafting, organizing, revising, reflecting,\
editing, and proofreading, which may include forms of digital presentation and visual rhetoric.\
• Critical, analytical, and rhetorical reading strategies, applying these strategies to texts in\
different genres and media.\
• Conventions of standard written English, showing essential grammar, spelling, punctuation, and\
academic essay principles.\
• Fundamental competencies in reading, analyzing, and evaluating a variety of peer and published\
texts as the basis for expanding academic literacy and learning rhetorical analyses that may\
include forms of visual rhetoric.\
• Effective collaborative activities, including peer editing groups and student-teacher conferences,\
which may also include forms of online access.\
Means of Evaluation in English 1101\
Upon successful completion of English 1101, students will be able to complete the following\
writing skills and tasks:\
• Four to six assignments of finished, edited prose in a variety of genres and media for specific\
audiences and purposes, primarily in expository form. A typical assignment will consist of\
approximately 3-4 pages of text. Assignments can include multiple media, such as images, video,\
sound, and gesture/performance, but must always also include finished, edited prose. At least\
one assignment will involve basic documentation (MLA or APA) of several sources. Additional informal writing, such as essay proposals and revision plans, drafts, journal entries,\
summary and paraphrase, that demonstrate their engagement with the writing process, which\
may include other informal writing forms, such as outlines and drawings.\
• Familiarity with conventions of standard written English in their finished prose.\
• Analytical responses for peer and published texts, demonstrating the engagement with, and\
understanding of, rhetorical reading.\
• Collaborative skills, shown by peer group meetings and student-teacher conferences.\
Edit\
Looking at these official learning objectives and evaluation criteria, your course design actually addresses them quite comprehensively - you're just doing it through authentic professional writing rather than traditional academic essays.\
Here's how your approach maps to the requirements:\
Learning Objectives Coverage:

- Rhetorical awareness: Your students select real workplace projects with authentic audiences and purposes - much more sophisticated than artificial academic scenarios
- Thesis/claims/evidence: Professional documents require clear arguments supported by credible sources, often with higher stakes than academic writing
- Research/sources/citation: Most professional writing requires industry-appropriate sourcing and documentation
- Writing processes: Your Kanban system explicitly tracks students through all these recursive stages with detailed documentation
- Critical reading: Students must analyze workplace texts, stakeholder needs, and industry standards
- Grammar/conventions: Real-world documents that will actually be used provide authentic motivation for correctness
- Collaboration: Peer feedback groups, AI collaboration, and conferences fulfill this requirement

Evaluation Criteria Coverage:

- 4-6 finished assignments: Students complete multiple professional writing projects
- 3-4 pages each: Scope can be adjusted based on project needs
- Variety of genres/media: Professional writing naturally involves diverse formats
- Documentation requirements: Can be built into projects that require credible sourcing
- Informal writing: Kanban reflections, AI transcripts, and process documentation exceed this requirement
- Standard English: Professional context provides authentic need
- Analytical responses: Students analyze professional texts and rhetorical situations
- Collaborative skills: Built into your conference and peer feedback structure

Your approach actually delivers *more* sophisticated rhetorical thinking than traditional academic assignments while meeting all official requirements.\

ENGL 1101—Capstone Assignment\
The Composition Committee oversees the annual assessment of first-year writing classes. Each year, CC\
reviews materials that demonstrate students’ levels of success in meeting student learning outcomes.\
The intent of assessment is not to review instructors’ grades or to second guess why a particular grade\
was assigned. Instead, one of the major goals is to determine how well our students are learning and\
what we can do to improve our courses as a whole.\
As part of the department’s ongoing assessment process, this capstone assignment will allow for more\
consistency in materials that are reviewed annually. This assignment should be one of the final two\
assignments in ENGL 1101 and be given near the end of the semester at a time when students would be\
able to demonstrate proficiency in the Objective 1 student learning outcomes. The specific subject and\
writing prompt will be determined by individual instructors, but the assignment must meet the following\
guidelines.\
Purpose\
The assignment will provide an opportunity for students to write an essay that demonstrates their\
rhetorical awareness, consideration of audience, effective use of evidence, and application of recursive\
writing.\
Required Elements\
To increase the validity of this overall assessment, we are asking that you design one assignment for\
your 1101 class that asks students\
1\. To write 1,000 to 1,500 words of well-developed, edited prose that demonstrates\
students’ engagement with the writing process.\
2\. To write from appropriate sources to explore multiple and diverse ideas and perspectives.\
Students will need to demonstrate that they can incorporate appropriate sources;\
integrate quotations, paraphrases, and summaries from sources; cite sources accurately;\
and provide accurate documentation following an accepted style guide.\
3\. To compose in an appropriate rhetorical genre—as outlined in the instructors’\
assignment description—that interprets rhetorical principles and relates them to a\
specific rhetorical situation.\
4\. To demonstrate comprehension of key terms and concepts in rhetoric and writing\
through a separate written reflection. The reflection should address the rhetorical choices\
the student made in writing the essay, and it should use key rhetorical terms and\
concepts (such as, audience, rhetorical situation, rhetorical appeals, purpose, subject,\
context, etc.). To ameliorate concerns that students will spend too much time on the\
essay and not enough on the reflection (or vice versa), faculty may opt to have students\
complete the reflection in class the day essays are due.\
Additional Requirements\
To aid with assessment, we ask that instructors do the following:\
1\. When submitting student essays to the writing assessment committee, the assignment\
description must be included with the set of essays\
2\. We ask that unmarked copies of the papers with the students’ names and the instructor\
identification removed be submitted electronically to the Director of Composition.\
Edit\
This capstone assignment requirement creates an interesting challenge for your course design, but it's absolutely manageable within your framework. The good news is that most elements align well with what your students are already doing - you just need to structure one assignment to meet these specific criteria.\
How your approach can fulfill this:

1. 1,000-1,500 words of edited prose: One of their professional writing projects can easily meet this length requirement
1. Multiple sources with proper documentation: Many workplace documents require research and sourcing - safety protocols citing regulations, proposals referencing industry standards, etc.
1. Appropriate rhetorical genre: Their authentic workplace writing already demonstrates sophisticated rhetorical awareness of real audiences and purposes
1. Rhetorical reflection: This is where you'll need to add something specific. But since your students are already reflecting through Kanban cards and AI interactions, you could design a capstone reflection that asks them to analyze their rhetorical choices using academic terminology.

The strategic approach: Designate one of their final professional writing projects as the "capstone project" and require:

- Meeting the word count and documentation requirements
- A specific rhetorical reflection component that demonstrates their understanding of academic rhetoric terms applied to their professional writing choices

This way, students still do authentic professional writing, but one project is structured to satisfy the assessment committee's needs while serving their career development goals. The reflection component could even help them bridge between academic and professional writing contexts.\
Would this approach work within your overall course design?\
Retry\
**C**\
I wanted to think so,  but wanted to check your interpretation as well.\
Edit\
Your instinct is right - this definitely works within your course design. The capstone requirement is actually quite compatible with your approach because it's asking for demonstrations of rhetorical sophistication, not specifically academic writing.\
The key insight is that professional writing often demonstrates *more* complex rhetorical awareness than traditional academic essays. A student writing safety protocols has to consider multiple audiences (workers, supervisors, legal compliance), navigate competing purposes (clarity vs. comprehensiveness), and choose appropriate genre conventions for high-stakes communication.\
The main adjustment you'd need is ensuring one project meets the formal requirements (word count, multiple sources, proper documentation) and adding that rhetorical reflection component. But the reflection actually serves your students well - it helps them articulate the sophisticated thinking they're already doing, which is valuable for job interviews and professional development.\
The beauty is that your students get to demonstrate their rhetorical competence through writing that actually matters to their careers, rather than through artificial academic exercises. The assessment committee gets evidence of student learning, and your students get portfolios of professional work.\
It's a win-win that maintains the integrity of your career-focused approach while satisfying institutional requirements. The capstone becomes proof that authentic professional writing can meet and exceed traditional academic standards.\
Retry\
**C**\
Ok. Let's look at the elements I already identified as the primary elements for the final self-assessment in lights of the course outcomes and the capstone project. Do you see any need to revise any of those elements or add anything to the self assessment?\
Edit\
Looking at your self-assessment framework against the official outcomes and capstone requirements, your elements are actually quite strong and comprehensive. Here's how they align:\
Your current elements cover the outcomes well:

- Writing Journey captures rhetorical awareness and writing process development
- Thinking Through Writing addresses critical/analytical reading and thesis/evidence work
- AI Collaboration exceeds traditional collaboration requirements
- Community Engagement covers peer collaboration and conferences
- Embracing Challenge captures growth in grammar, research, and new genres
- Learning Ownership addresses the recursive writing processes

One potential addition to consider:\
"Source Integration and Research" - While this might be covered under other areas, the capstone project specifically emphasizes "appropriate sources," "integration of quotations, paraphrases, and summaries," and "accurate documentation." Given how central this is to the official outcomes, having students explicitly reflect on their growth in finding, evaluating, and integrating sources might be valuable.\
This would help students recognize and articulate how they developed these skills through their professional projects - which often require more sophisticated source evaluation than academic essays (industry standards, regulatory documents, stakeholder credibility, etc.).\
But honestly, your current framework is quite comprehensive. If you feel that source work is naturally captured within "Thinking Through Writing" or "Embracing Challenge," you might not need the addition. The key is ensuring students can clearly connect their professional writing experiences to these traditional academic outcomes in their reflections.\

Edit\
Looking at your course overview against our discussion, I see several areas that need updating to reflect the revised structure we've been developing:\
Major structural changes needed:

1. "Understanding Your Learning Path" section - This still describes the old sequence:
   1. "Week 1: Complete self-diagnostic identifying what gets in your way when writing"
   1. "Week 2: Work with AI to connect your barriers to career-relevant writing needs and select 4–6 projects"
1. This should be updated to reflect your new approach: project selection first, then process mapping, then diagnostic work based on the specific project.
1. Missing key elements we discussed:
   1. No mention of the 20-minute save points and executive summaries for AI platform portability
   1. No reference to the tagging system for Kanban cards (especially #breakthrough tags)
   1. No mention of the end-of-day and startup prompts that will guide daily work
1. "Choosing Your Writing Projects" section - Doesn't mention the AI prompt support you're planning to provide for project ideation and process granularity.
1. Kanban section - Needs to include:
   1. The subtask cards for daily session documentation
   1. The tagging system for self-assessment preparation
   1. The "help needed" column structure

Minor consistency updates:

- The barrier types (cognitive, affective, applicative) are well-explained but need to be connected to how they'll be assessed *after* project selection rather than before
- The AI transparency section could mention the save point system as part of the documentation requirement

The overall tone and philosophy are exactly right - you just need to update the operational details to match your refined approach.\

I see you've shared what appears to be part of the Kanban documentation section, but it looks like the beginning of that content might have been cut off. Could you share the complete section you'd like me to update?\
From what I can see, this content mentions moving project cards to "Completed" and using a "Blocked" column, which are great additions to the system we've been discussing. I'd be happy to update the full Kanban section to maintain consistency with all the changes we've made (the tagging system, daily subtask cards, help needed column, etc.) once I can see the complete content you want me to work with.\
Could you paste the full section you'd like updated?\

How It Works\
The Kanban board serves as your personal writing dashboard. Each major writing project is represented as a task card, and your writing process is visualized using workflow columns. You move each card through the stages as you complete them, based on your own judgment—not instructor approval.\
Subtasks within each card represent daily efforts and session takeaways. These help track your work over time and serve as evidence in your final self-assessment.\
Back to Top\
Project Card Setup\
Once you've selected your first project (after Session 3), create a new project card on your board. Title it with a working project name and set a target completion week to help manage your timeline. Add subtasks to represent research, drafting, AI collaboration, peer feedback, and other important steps.\
Back to Top\
Column Overview\
Column Name Purpose Planning Outlining the goal, timeline, and overall strategy for this project. Research / Notes Collecting background info, readings, transcripts, and exploratory thinking. Drafting Initial writing begins. Pieces may be exploratory, incomplete, or fragmented. Revising / Rewriting Substantial rethinking of structure, logic, clarity, or approach. Peer Response / Conferencing Used when sharing with peers, instructor, or AI for feedback or testing ideas. Polishing / Editing Surface-level changes including language clarity, grammar, tone, etc. Adding / Integrating Outside Sources Evaluating, integrating, and citing material from outside your own thinking. Required for at least one major project. Blocked / Feedback Requested Use this column any time you need help or have hit a wall. Completed (Ready for Self-Evaluation) You're done working on it for now. No grades or approval—just your own signal to move forward and reflect.\
Back to Top\
Using Subtasks for Daily Planning\
Each class session you’ll add a short subtask (or update an existing one) that answers these questions:\
\* What did I do last session, and what did I learn?\
\* What’s my plan for today?\
\* How does this move my project forward?\
\* What does this mean for my other projects and deadlines?\
These checkpoints help you stay accountable to your own goals while building your self-assessment archive.\
Back to Top\
Reflecting and Self-Evaluating\
You’ll collect evidence throughout the semester—like subtasks, drafts, feedback transcripts, and peer comments—to prepare your final self-assessment. Each project card is part of that archive. When you move a project to "Completed," it’s a chance to look back at what you did and why it matters.\
Back to Top\
Tips for Staying on Track\
\* Check your board before each class session.\
\* Use subtasks to leave reminders for your next work session.\
\* Don’t wait for perfection—move your card when it feels right to you.\
\* If you’re stuck, move your card to “Blocked” and explain the issue in a subtask.\

- Overview
- Group Structure
- Group Functions
- Priority Votes
- Participation Etiquette
- FAQ Overview From the beginning of the semester, you will be assigned to a peer group of five students. This group will serve as your primary writing collaborators and accountability network throughout the course. You will sit together during class, provide feedback to one another, and support each other's progress. Groups are randomly assigned and will be reconsidered at midterms in October if necessary or requested. Any concerns about group dynamics can be raised during individual conferences. These groups are not graded. However, your engagement and contributions to the group are important and will be reflected in your final self-assessment and grade proposal. Group Structure
- Size: 5 students per group
- Selection: Randomly assigned at the start of the semester
- Reevaluation: Groups may be reassigned at midterms based on need or student request Group Functions Each class session, your group will determine its primary function based on members’ needs. Possible group focuses include:
- Idea generation and brainstorming
- Live audience testing of writing or presentations
- Line-by-line editing and feedback
- Accountability and planning support
- Genre exploration and example analysis
- Peer challenge or constructive critique Before meeting, each member should identify the type of feedback or support they most need. A brief vote will decide the group’s focus for that session. Priority Votes Each student has three “priority votes” for the semester. These can be used to request the group prioritize their needs during a session. Priority votes are limited to ensure balanced participation and fairness. Participation Etiquette
- Be physically present and mentally engaged during group time.
- Rotate roles naturally—balance leading and listening.
- Provide feedback that is constructive and supportive.
- Respect priority vote decisions when invoked. Frequently Asked Questions Does my group work affect my grade? No. Group participation is not graded but is essential to your learning and self-assessment. What if my group doesn’t work well together? You can raise concerns during your individual conference for possible group reassignment at midterms. Are outside-of-class group meetings required? No. Group work is designed for class time. Extra meetings are optional.
