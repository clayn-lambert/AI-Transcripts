**C**\
Good morning, Claude. I would like to create a script for a voice-over orientation video for an fully online asynchronous postsecondary CTE survey class on ethics hosted in Canvas. The main landing page hosts a series of html panels displayed as interactive buttons that jump to various parts of an html document. I'd like the video to briefly introduce the scope of the course, introduce me as the instructor, and then walk students through the various tabs on the front page, without it becoming monotonous or redundant; they can read the various sections as needed and don't need me to regurgitate it for them. Here is a list of the tables of content for each of the tabs. Could you generate the script based on these parameters, please? I'd suggest the overall time frame to be around 5 minutes or less, but without things feeling rushed. I'd love the tone to be self-deprecating and fully aware that the narrator is an AI; AI is a big theme and tool used throughout the course to support student learning. I'd like to aim for a dry humor in tone if at all possible...\

\*\*[OPENING - Warm but knowing tone]\*\*

Good morning, and welcome to what I like to call "Ethics: The Course Where We Pretend I'm Not an AI While Talking About AI Ethics."\
I've created a 4.5-minute script that balances information delivery with self-aware AI humor. The script maintains a conversational pace while covering all your navigation tabs without simply reading their contents back to students.\
Key features of the script:

- Self-deprecating AI awareness throughout, acknowledging the irony of an AI teaching ethics
- Dry humor woven into explanations without undermining the course's academic credibility
- Efficient navigation that highlights each tab's purpose rather than listing contents
- Encouraging but realistic tone that sets appropriate expectations
- Meta-commentary on the AI/ethics intersection that reinforces course themes

The script assumes a conversational speaking pace (around 180-200 words per minute) and includes natural pauses and emphasis cues. Would you like me to adjust the tone, length, or focus on any particular sections?\

Great start. Now for some additional edits. AI isn't the instructor, that's me. Clayn Lambert, and we should probably figure out some kind of intro for me. It's just that listening to myself when I record things has about the same level of excitement as watching 3 day old oatmeal congeal and has the auditory effect of Ambien. So, I love the AI references, but let's be clear about the fact that I am still involved, even though I have been using AI extensively to HELP me, not replace me, in the design process. Mkay?\

Perfect! I've revised the script to properly introduce you as Clayn Lambert, the human instructor, while maintaining the self-deprecating humor about your voice and the extensive AI collaboration in course design. The script now clearly positions AI as your helpful assistant rather than your replacement, while keeping all the dry humor about the recursive nature of using AI to teach about AI ethics.\
The opening now includes your self-aware commentary about needing AI help to sound less like "day-old oatmeal," which should get some chuckles while setting the right tone about human-AI collaboration throughout the course.\

Let's add in something about the idea that there are no traditional grades or grading points attached to course activities; everything serves only to help you demonstrate the process of how you worked on the conflict map and explored insights to various models.

How-To Guide\
This guide gives you step-by-step instructions for using the tools in this class—especially ClickUp and your AI assistant. You’ll learn how to create, organize, and update your ClickUp tasks, and how to interact effectively with AI agents.\

ClickUp: What You Need to Know\
ClickUp is the main project management tool we’ll use to keep track of your ethics work. You’ll be invited to join a shared public board with all class members. Each major assignment or “Part” in this course will have its own task card. As you work, you’ll move your tasks through status columns to show your progress.\
\* Task Cards: Represent Parts 1–5 of your project.\
\* Columns: To-Do, In Progress, Blocked / Need Help, Complete.\
\* Subtasks: Track work sessions for each Part.\
\* Assignments: Cards are assigned to individuals to make them private to you and the instructor.\
Back to Top ↑\
ClickUp Setup: How to Get Started\
1\. Accept Your Invitation\
You’ll receive an email invitation to join the shared class ClickUp board. Click the link and sign in with your student email address. If you don’t have an account, it will prompt you to create one.\
2\. Locate Your Task Cards\
Once inside the board, look for cards labeled Part 1, Part 2, Part 3... through Part 5. These are the major project stages you'll complete during the semester. Each card will be assigned to you, which makes your work visible only to you and the instructor.\
3\. Understand the Columns\
Each task moves through the columns as your work progresses:\
\* To-Do: You haven’t started this Part yet.\
\* In Progress: You’re actively working on this Part.\
\* Blocked / Need Help: You’re stuck and need instructor guidance.\
\* Complete: You’ve submitted and reflected on this Part.\
Back to Top ↑\
How to Use ClickUp Effectively\
Creating a Task Card (if needed)\
1\. Click the + New Task button.\
2\. Name your task something like Part 3 – Role Analysis.\
3\. Assign it to yourself so only you and the instructor can view it.\
4\. Select the appropriate status column (e.g., To-Do).\
Moving a Card to a New Column\
1\. Click and hold your task card.\
2\. Drag it to the next status column (e.g., from “To-Do” to “In Progress”).\
3\. Release to drop it into place.\
Adding a Subtask for a Work Session\
1\. Open your main task card (e.g., Part 2).\
2\. Click + Subtask.\
3\. Give it a title like Brainstorming ethical stakeholders – July 31.\
4\. Repeat this whenever you work on that Part. Try to add at least one subtask per week (by Sunday), or more often as needed.\
Marking a Task as Blocked\
1\. Drag your card into the Blocked / Need Help column.\
2\. Optionally, add a comment explaining the issue so the instructor can respond more quickly.\

AI Agent Basics\
You are free to use any platform-agnostic AI assistant (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity) during this course. You’ll interact with your chosen AI to help you analyze dilemmas, reflect on your thinking, and test ideas from different ethical frameworks.\
Important: The AI doesn’t have memory between sessions. If you want to preserve your progress, you’ll need to create and paste back in checkpoints (see the “Why AI?” tab).\
Back to Top ↑\
Best Practices for Interacting with AI\
\* Be clear about your goals. Tell the AI what you’re trying to do.\
\* Talk through your ideas, not just ask for answers.\
\* Use checkpoints every 8–10 turns to save progress.\
\* Keep AI responses focused—don’t let it wander or overgeneralize.\
\* If confused, ask the AI to restate or simplify its explanation.\
\* Paste previous checkpoints into a new session to restore context.\

The bike-riding analogy helps clarify that this is about practical implementation rather than theoretical understanding.\
