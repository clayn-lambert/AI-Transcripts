I am trying to design a solution to a comment I received from a student who expressed that they didn't understand how to start the course. This was your first draft suggestion about how to proceed. I am not sure I love the idea of a trial "project" but I do get the idea of making sure students are used to interacting with AI if they haven't done it before, and giving them a much more concrete approach to how to start a full self-contained course. Perhaps an interview about their existing thoughts and impressions about the nature and definition of ethics? Something that isn't graded; nothing in this class is "graded," but something that is much more informal and introduces AI as a conversational interaction?\
Edit\
You're absolutely right that the trial "friendship" project feels artificial and disconnected from the real work. Here's a more organic approach that serves the same preparatory function:\
Day 3-4: AI Partnership Practice Through Ethics Exploration (1-2 hours total)\
Warm-up Conversation: Your Ethics Intuitions (45 minutes)\
Copy this prompt into your AI tool:

I'm starting an ethics course that uses AI as a thinking partner. Before diving into my own ethical dilemmas, I want to explore what I already think about ethics in general. Please have a casual conversation with me about my existing views on ethics - not to teach me theories, but to help me articulate what I already believe.

Start by asking me: "When you hear the word 'ethics,' what comes to mind first?"



During this conversation:

- Be genuinely curious about your own thinking
- Don't worry about being "right" - there are no wrong answers
- Let yourself ramble and explore tangents
- Notice when you feel uncertain or conflicted about something

Practice Checkpoint Creation (15 minutes) After 8-10 exchanges, ask: "Can you create a summary of what we've discovered about my current thinking on ethics?"\
Save this as: ETHICS\_[today's date]\_ethics\_intuitions\_checkpoint.md\
Test Session Continuity (30 minutes)

- Start a fresh AI session
- Paste your checkpoint
- Ask: "Based on this summary of my ethics intuitions, what would be interesting to explore next?"
- Have 4-5 more exchanges

You've now practiced the full workflow (conversation → checkpoint → resume) with content that's actually relevant to your course work.\
This approach:

- Feels purposeful rather than artificial
- Gets them thinking about ethics immediately
- Introduces the "archaeological" concept naturally (discovering their existing beliefs)
- Provides genuine material they might reference later
- Makes the AI feel like a thinking partner rather than a tool

The conversation often reveals interesting tensions or uncertainties that can seed their dilemma identification process. Much more integrated with the actual course goals.\

I like that! Could you integrate that into the attachment and make it something I can post directly into Canvas?\

Perfect! I've integrated the revised AI partnership practice section into the full roadmap. The new approach flows much more naturally - students explore their existing ethics intuitions first, which serves as both AI practice and genuine course preparation. This eliminates the artificial "friendship" exercise while still teaching checkpoint creation and session management with content that's actually relevant to their ethical archaeology work.\
The document is now Canvas-ready and provides a much more cohesive introduction to both the technology and the philosophical approach of the course.\

Let's revisit the Day 5-7 section. This section should be pointing the student to the AI prompts, specifically Part 1, rather than creating a new approach wholesale.\
Edit\
You're absolutely right! The Day 5-7 section should direct students to the existing Part 1 AI prompts rather than duplicating or replacing them. Let me fix that:\

Much better! Now the roadmap properly directs students to use the existing Part 1 AI prompts rather than creating a redundant or potentially conflicting approach. This maintains consistency with your course design and ensures students are using the carefully crafted prompts you've already developed.\

Perfect! Removed the reference to student experience since this is all pilot material. The instruction now simply emphasizes using the provided prompts without making claims about refinement based on prior use.\
