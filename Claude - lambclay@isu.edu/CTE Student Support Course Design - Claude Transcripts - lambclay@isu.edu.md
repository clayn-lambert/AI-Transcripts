**C**\
Quick summary of our progression: Started with concerns about student-centered course design for at-risk CTE students → explored contract grading and conference-heavy structure → identified the challenge of providing individualized support to kinesthetic learners → discovered AI as a potential coaching/feedback solution → tested scenarios that revealed both possibilities and pitfalls → found existing resources but recognized need for authentic engagement → worked through equity and trust concerns → landed on framing AI as solution to the real problem of getting thoughtful feedback in a distracted world.\
Key insight: AI as patient, focused conversation partner rather than fancy technology - addressing the genuine need for someone to think through problems with, especially relevant for students who've experienced rushed, inattentive interactions.\
Next conversation focus: Developing the nature and scope of the contract and how final grades would be determined\
Edit\
Perfect summary - you've captured the evolution beautifully, especially that key insight about AI as a patient conversation partner rather than flashy tech. That reframing from "look what AI can do" to "here's how we solve the real problem of getting quality thinking time" is crucial for authentic implementation.\
So now we're at the practical heart of contract grading: what exactly are students contracting to do, and how does that translate to a final grade? This is where the rubber meets the road.\
Some key questions to work through:\
The contract itself - Are we talking about students choosing from pre-designed contract levels (like "C contract requires X, Y, Z; B contract adds A, B, C")? Or more individualized contracts negotiated between student and instructor? How much choice and agency do students actually have?\
Grade determination - Is it purely completion-based (fulfill contract = guaranteed grade), or is there still some quality threshold? How do we handle the student who technically meets contract terms but clearly hasn't engaged meaningfully?\
The revision/adjustment piece - Can students renegotiate mid-semester if they realize they over/under-committed? What happens when life intervenes?\
CTE-specific considerations - How do industry standards and certification requirements factor in? Some skills probably aren't negotiable regardless of contract level.\
Where do you want to dig in first? The structure of contract options, the grading mechanics, or something else entirely?\
Retry\
**C**\
Grading mechanics I believe. The course is likely to be populated with a broad spectrum of students in terms of prior learning and skill. My hope is to provide an environment where students predisposed to do well will be challenged independently of students with significant educational trauma or deficits. Even incremental improvements among the latter group deserve as much recognition as those who came into class already on third base, as the saying goes.\
Edit\
Yes, this is the equity heart of contract grading - recognizing that "achievement" looks radically different depending on starting point, and that the student making their first-ever successful presentation deserves as much recognition as the one who arrived with polished communication skills.\
A few approaches to consider for the grading mechanics:\
Growth-based contracts - Instead of fixed deliverables, students contract for specific growth targets relative to their starting point. This requires some form of baseline assessment, but then a student might contract to "demonstrate measurable improvement in 3 specific communication skills" rather than "deliver 5 presentations at B-level quality."\
Competency progression model - Students move through skill levels at their own pace, with the contract specifying how many competencies they'll master and to what depth. Someone starting at novice level might contract to reach "developing" in 6 areas, while someone starting higher might aim for "proficient" in 3 areas.\
Effort + growth hybrid - Contract specifies sustained engagement (showing up, participating, revising work) plus documented growth in chosen areas. This acknowledges that effort alone isn't enough, but also doesn't penalize students who work harder for smaller gains.\
Portfolio-based with narrative - Students contract to build a portfolio demonstrating their learning journey, with significant weight on reflection and articulation of growth, not just final products.\
Which of these resonates, or does it spark another direction entirely? And how do you envision handling the student who wants to challenge themselves versus the one who's just trying to survive and pass?\
Retry\
**C**\
Definitely the portfolio approach. I want something that de-emphasizes product as the primary measure of growth over impact and significance. Since my plan is to use AI interactions to allow students to mold their own learning courses, and to determine what might work (in collaboration with me during their weekly conferences), I want there to be a greater attention to interactions and collaborations between the learner and the feedback they're getting. My plan is to ask students to copy the full transcript of every interaction they have with AI into their portfolio, so I can see the kinds of questions, responses, and thinking that is going on "behind the scenes." This will shape my conferencing and, in my opinion, is more important than the actual work products that are submitted.\
Edit\
This is brilliant - you're essentially making the thinking process visible and assessable, which is usually the most valuable part of learning but also the most hidden. The AI transcripts become a window into how students approach problems, what they're curious about, how they iterate and refine their thinking.\
This approach has some powerful implications:\
The real learning is in the conversation - A student who asks thoughtful follow-up questions, challenges the AI's responses, or applies feedback in meaningful ways is demonstrating deeper learning than one who just uses AI to generate a final product. You can actually see the gears turning.\
Equity in a different way - Students can't fake having good conversations with AI over time. The quality of their thinking emerges naturally through the iterative process, regardless of their starting point or writing ability. A student with significant educational trauma might have shorter, more hesitant early interactions that gradually become more confident - that's a powerful story of growth.\
Your conferences become coaching - Instead of evaluating finished products, you're analyzing how students think and offering strategies for better questioning, reflection, or problem-solving. "I noticed you asked this type of question repeatedly - let's explore what else you might try."\
The portfolio then becomes a collection of these conversations plus reflection on how their thinking evolved. How are you envisioning the reflection piece? Are students analyzing their own AI interactions, or is that something you're reading between the lines?\
And what about the final grade determination - is it about the quality of thinking they demonstrate through these interactions?\
Retry\
**C**\
My plan is to give all students a self-reflection diagnostic as the first activity in the first class, where they rate their level of college-level readiness on each of the established course learning outcomes. The final reflection will be a second iteration of that same diagnostic, but any changes in the ratings need to be substantiated with callbacks to what has been done in the body of the course to warrant the change claims. Even though it is highly subjective (which makes my traditionalist tendencies twinge a bit), I want the student to have the chance to argue about the nature of changes they have experienced from their time in the class, rather than having work speak for them. That only privileges those who are adept at academic work, not real intellectual growth. But you raise a good question about those whose work is technically acceptable but does not evidence meaningful engagement. I suppose that if their performance rises to the level of college-ready, it isn't really germane to the conversation. They have met the unstated expectations for the course - can you write like a college student?\
Edit\
You've identified something really profound here - the tension between what we think rigor looks like (complex analysis, sophisticated products) versus what it actually should be (honest self-assessment, evidence-based reflection on growth, ability to articulate one's own learning journey). That's actually much harder than writing a traditional paper.\
The "technically acceptable but not engaged" student is revealing in your framework. If they can convincingly argue that they've become college-ready writers with evidence from their portfolio, then by your course's definition, they *have* been meaningfully engaged - even if it doesn't look like what we traditionally expect engagement to look like. The portfolio and AI transcripts would reveal whether their claim is substantiated or just empty assertion.\
This also solves the equity issue elegantly. The student who arrived with weak writing skills but can document a journey from "I avoid writing because I'm terrible at it" to "I can approach writing assignments with confidence and strategies" has a powerful story to tell. The one who came in already skilled but can show how they pushed into more complex thinking or refined their process also has a legitimate claim to growth.\
The real rigor is in making students accountable for their own learning story with evidence. That's a much more mature, professional skill than producing work that meets someone else's rubric.\
How are you thinking about the grade conversion? Is it simply: "If you can credibly argue you've become college-ready with portfolio evidence, you pass"? Or are you envisioning different levels of growth corresponding to different grades?\
Retry\
**C**\
Well, the grade system for the course uses letter grades, so some level of gradation is important and I really feel that I need to have a solid understanding of what it might look like in general before the class begins - I hate moving the bar around after classes start; it feels dishonest. But I am very comfortable with changing the goalposts or expectations for different students if they can take the initiative to ask for those kinds of accommodations.\
Edit\
That's a really important distinction - stable system, flexible application. You need a framework solid enough to communicate clearly from day one, but nimble enough to honor individual circumstances without arbitrary rule changes.\
Here's one way to think about the grade gradation within your framework:\
The constant across all grades: Student demonstrates growth from pre/post diagnostic with credible evidence from portfolio/AI transcripts.\
The variable by grade level might be:

- Scope of growth (how many learning outcomes they can legitimately claim progress on)
- Quality of evidence (depth/thoughtfulness of the examples they cite from their portfolio)
- Sophistication of reflection (complexity of their thinking about their own learning process)
- Consistency of engagement (sustained effort/interaction throughout the semester vs. minimal)

So a C might be: "I can demonstrate growth in 3 of 6 learning outcomes with basic evidence from my portfolio work" while an A might be: "I can demonstrate significant growth in 5 of 6 learning outcomes with rich, specific evidence and sophisticated reflection on my learning process."\
The beauty is that two students might both earn an A by this definition while having completely different skill levels and starting points. The frame is stable; the content is personalized.\
Does this kind of gradation align with your thinking? Or are you imagining different variables that would distinguish between grade levels?\
Retry\
**C**\
I can agree with the concept in general, but I am a little leery of the numerical basis; it still feels product-centric. I think the argument should be contextualized by the student's own acknowledgement of their initial standing and capacity and why they chose to focus their efforts where they did. For instance, I think of the student who identifies which core outcomes most align with their career trajectory and choose to invest all their time in improving those traits, even if there are only 2-3. Or the student who reveals their extraneous struggles with language (due to disability, ESL, etc.) and who are lifting heavy weights that have little specific basis in the class content, but which are clearly relevant. I think that the final grade conversation begins from the very beginning of the course and that the student is consistently making this argument almost every class period as part of their justification for what they are choosing to work on and how they perform.\
Edit\
Yes, absolutely - the numerical breakdown was still carrying that traditional mindset of "more is better" when what you're really after is "most meaningful for this learner is better." The student who goes deep on 2-3 outcomes that align with their career goals might be showing more sophisticated thinking than someone who spreads effort across 5-6 just to check boxes.\
And you're absolutely right that the final grade conversation begins from day one. It sounds like you're envisioning something more like building a case throughout the semester - each week's conference the student is essentially making the argument: "Here's what I'm working on, here's why it matters for my growth, here's how I'm using feedback to improve." The portfolio becomes evidence for that ongoing argument, not just a collection of work.\
This makes the final reflection much more sophisticated - it's not just "rate yourself and provide evidence" but "synthesize your semester-long argument about your learning choices and their impact on your growth." The student who focused on 2-3 outcomes needs to articulate why that was the right choice for their goals and how they maximized growth within those areas.\
This also makes the process much more authentic to how real learning happens - we make choices about where to invest our energy based on our priorities, obstacles, and goals. The student managing language challenges isn't making excuses; they're managing their learning strategically.\
Are you thinking the final grade is more like approving the student's case they've been building all semester, with the letter grade reflecting the quality of that case rather than any predetermined metric?\
Retry\
**C**\
Sort of. The grade is the approbation of their entire learning strategy and the degree to which they carried it out effectively, not just on how well they articulate that thought at the end of the course. A student could have a very compelling argument about why they chose to learn the way they did, but if they were lackadaisical in their execution, the execution is reflected in the grade. It isn't just about the narrative; it is the summation of the totality of their experience. Did they simply ask the AI to walk them through everything, even if they did the final work? Or did they get direction from AI, then performed tasks on their own and used the AI as intended, as a consistent feedback engine? What was the tone, focus, and impact of their conference sessions with me? What did they do as part of their feedback groups?\
Edit\
Now I see it - you're evaluating the coherence between their learning strategy and their execution of it. The student who says "I focused on these 2 outcomes because they align with my career goals" but then shows lackadaisical AI interactions, surface-level conference participation, and minimal engagement with feedback - that's a mismatch between vision and execution that would be reflected in the grade.\
Conversely, the student who says "I struggled with these 3 outcomes because of my language barriers, so I focused intensively on building foundation skills" and then demonstrates consistent, thoughtful work with AI as a feedback tool, brings specific questions to conferences, and actively engages with peer feedback - that's a cohesive learning strategy well-executed.\
The AI transcripts become crucial evidence here - not just of what they produced, but how they worked. The student who consistently uses AI as a thinking partner, iterates on feedback, and asks increasingly sophisticated questions is demonstrating a different quality of learning than the one who asks for completed work or never builds on the AI's suggestions.\
The grade becomes a holistic evaluation of: strategic thinking about their own learning needs + consistent, thoughtful execution of that strategy + appropriate use of all available resources (AI, conferences, peer feedback) in service of that strategy.\
This actually makes the grading more objective in a way - you're not judging arbitrary standards but evaluating how well they matched their actions to their stated learning goals. The quality of their execution is visible in the portfolio evidence.\
Does this capture how you're thinking about it?\
Retry\
**C**\
I think so. But I worry about something we talked about superficially in a different conversation that relates back to this entire visualization of grading. Many of the students coming into this class have not performed well academically. They may very well be lacking the very skills (self-reflection, self-regulation, time and activity management) upon which this approach is predicated. Yes, I may be able to promote activities within the course context to help refine or introduce these things, but am I putting too much weight on this approach to meet the reality of the students from the beginning?\
Edit\
This is the crucial question - you're potentially asking students to master complex metacognitive skills (self-reflection, strategic thinking, self-regulation) as the *means* of learning, when those might be the very skills they need to *develop* in the first place. It's a bit like asking someone to use a map to navigate when they haven't learned to read maps yet.\
Some of your students might be coming from educational experiences where the message was "just do what you're told, don't ask questions" - the opposite of strategic, self-directed learning. Others might have developed learned helplessness around academic tasks. Still others might have never had anyone ask "What do you think would help you learn this?" because their previous teachers were just trying to get through the curriculum.\
But here's what's encouraging about your approach: you're not throwing them into the deep end alone. You have weekly conferences where you can scaffold these skills, you have AI as a patient thinking partner, you have peer feedback groups. These are all supports for developing the metacognitive skills they need.\
Maybe the question isn't whether to use this approach, but how to build more explicit scaffolding in the early weeks? Like starting with very structured self-reflection prompts, or modeling strategic thinking in those first conferences, or having some students work with more guided AI prompts initially?\
What's your sense of how much explicit teaching of these meta-skills might be needed alongside the content work?\
Retry\
**C**\
I think for the majority of students, they are going to need a lot of scaffolding. Additionally, the course requires the students to compose a minimum of 4 complete writing submissions, each around 2-3 pages of written prose. So the learning they are going to be doing in terms of learning outcomes is going to be tied to the production of these written works. But like I said earlier, I want to de-emphasize the idea that these submissions are the primary means of evaluation; that is what pushes students to use AI unethically in most cases, because the focus is on the product, not the process.\
Edit\
This is a really important tension - you need the writing assignments as vehicles for learning and practice, but if students see them as the main assessment, they'll be tempted to take shortcuts that bypass the actual learning.\
Here's what I'm hearing: the 4 writing submissions are more like controlled experiments where students apply what they're learning about themselves as writers and thinkers. The *real* assessment is in how they approach these assignments - the questions they ask AI, the way they use feedback, how they reflect on their process, and what they learn about their own writing in the doing.\
For scaffolding, you might need to make the process more explicit in the early weeks. Maybe something like:\
Week 1-2: Very structured self-reflection prompts and guided AI interactions. "Ask the AI this specific question about your draft. Record the AI's response. Then try this specific technique and ask the AI to evaluate your revision."\
Week 3-4: More open-ended but still guided. "Based on your diagnostic, what's one specific writing challenge you want to work on in this assignment? Design a conversation with the AI to get feedback on this specific area."\
Week 5+: Students increasingly self-direct their AI interactions and learning focus, with your conferences helping them develop more sophisticated strategies.\
The key message becomes: "These writing assignments are opportunities to practice the kind of strategic, feedback-driven improvement that will serve you beyond this class. The writing is how you practice; the learning is how you grow."\
Does this kind of gradual release of responsibility match what you're envisioning?\
Retry\
**C**\
Yes, I think so. I think my primary concern is that it feels as though there is a lot going on in terms of what I need students to be doing that I won't have any hand in. My main activity during class time will be conducting 1-on-1 conferences, so there aren't going to be lectures or presentations where I would be exerting some form of control or direction. I need to get students headed in the right direction, then completely release them as a group to find their way while I work individually. That causes more than a little consternation to me and my control-freakish heart, but intellectually, I know it's the right thing to do. And I have to get them focused on getting the writing samples completed because at least one of those is submitted to the department as a capstone assignment that is reviewed by the department committee. I want these students and their capacity to be able to stand and deliver when it counts, even if that isn't the real focus of what this class is trying to accomplish or what their grade is going to reflect.\
Edit\
That control-freak anxiety is so real - you're essentially orchestrating a complex learning environment where most of the important work happens outside your direct supervision. It's like being a conductor of an orchestra where the musicians are all in different rooms!\
But here's what might help with that anxiety: you're not actually losing control, you're shifting from controlling content delivery to controlling the learning architecture. Your conferences become strategic check-ins where you can course-correct quickly if students are heading in unproductive directions. The AI transcripts and portfolio work give you visibility into what's happening in those spaces you can't directly supervise.\
And there's something powerful about the fact that students will be working on real writing while you're conferencing with others. They're not just sitting through busy work - they're actively engaged in the work of the class. The natural hum of productive activity might actually be more conducive to learning than the artificial quiet of a lecture hall.\
The department capstone requirement is actually a good forcing function - it gives you a concrete standard to point to when helping students calibrate their efforts. You can say "This is what the department expects to see, so let's make sure your process gets you there" without that becoming the sole focus of your grading.\
How are you envisioning the class sessions structurally? Are students working on writing while you conference, or are they doing other activities? And how long are you planning for each conference?\
Retry\
**C**\
Conferences will last around 7 minutes each. The class session is 75 minutes long, two days a week. There are 14 students in the regular course section, which means about an hour of conferencing and the rest of the time accepting walk up students on a first come, first served basis. Students will also meet in small feedback groups at some point during the class period (it's up to them if they want to start with the meeting or end with it) where each person reports on what they are working on and how it is going. The student will be expected to enter a daily activity summary in their portfolio which will summarize that they did, how it went, a summary of their conference, and what they shared with their feedback group.\
Edit\
This is actually a really elegant system - the daily activity summary in the portfolio becomes the thread that connects all the pieces. Students can't just go through the motions because they have to reflect on and synthesize their conference, feedback group, and work time into a coherent narrative of their learning process.\
The 7-minute conferences feel about right for focused, strategic conversations. Long enough for substantive discussion, short enough to maintain momentum. And the walk-up time is brilliant - students who need more support can get it, while those who are working independently can continue without interruption.\
The peer feedback groups might actually be one of your most powerful scaffolding tools. Students will naturally learn from each other's approaches, and having to articulate their process to peers reinforces the metacognitive skills you're trying to develop. Plus, it gives you 14 informal assistants who can model productive AI interactions and problem-solving strategies.\
The daily summary becomes their record of integrating all these pieces - not just "I wrote 2 pages" but "I worked on my introduction, brought my structure question to my conference, got feedback about transitions from my group, and then revised my approach based on what I learned."\
I'm actually more curious about the logistics of the feedback groups. Are these consistent groups throughout the semester, or do they rotate? And how structured are these group meetings - is it more like "here's what I'm working on" or do they actually read each other's work?\
Retry\
**C**\
The groups will be randomly assigned at the beginning of the semester and remain in place until midterms. Then, if the group decides, they can stay together or disband and reform. I don't want self-formed groups to avoid cliques or disciplinary alignment. That rarely pushes students to push themselves. I hadn't thought  about having them read each other's work. Maybe a paragraph every other week? The meeting only lasts for 10 minutes, so there wouldn't be a lot of time to be able to read, ponder, address, and respond if we did that regularly, but some might be good.\
Edit\
The group structure sounds smart - those forced interactions often lead to the most valuable learning. And the midterm pivot option is nice because it gives groups a chance to gel, but also acknowledges that some combinations just don't work.\
For the work-sharing, I think your instinct is right - occasional paragraph exchanges might be more valuable than trying to squeeze in regular readings. Maybe something like "every third week, bring a paragraph you're struggling with" or "once a month, share a paragraph you're particularly proud of and explain why." That way it's targeted rather than rushed.\
The 10-minute format actually forces students to be strategic about what they bring to the group. They can't just dump everything on the table - they have to think about what they most need help with or what would be most useful to share. That selection process itself is valuable learning.\
And the mix of reporting on process ("here's what I'm working on") with occasional concrete examples (a paragraph to discuss) might give the best of both worlds. The process discussions build those metacognitive skills, while the concrete examples give the groups something tangible to work with.\
Given your conferencing schedule, these groups might actually become the place where students get their most sustained peer interaction. Are you thinking of giving them any structure for these 10-minute meetings, or letting them develop their own rhythm?\
Retry\
**C**\
I will probably scaffold a lot in the first weeks, like everything else, and then let them find their own vibe as time passes and they get a better sense of what they are doing and why.\
Edit\
That feels like the right approach - consistent with your overall philosophy of building the metacognitive skills they need and then stepping back to let them use them. The early scaffolding teaches them what productive peer feedback looks like, and then they can adapt it to their own needs and working styles.\
It's interesting how all the pieces of your system reinforce each other. The conferences help students develop strategic thinking about their work, the AI interactions give them practice with getting and using feedback, the peer groups help them articulate their process and learn from others, and the daily summaries force them to synthesize it all into a coherent narrative of their learning.\
The randomized groups might actually be crucial for this - students will be exposed to different approaches to the same challenges, which could be especially valuable for students with limited academic backgrounds. One student might discover a new way to approach revision by watching how their group-mate thinks about it.\
As you're thinking about the scaffolding for these groups, are you envisioning more structured prompts like "Share one specific challenge you're facing this week" or more open-ended like "Check in with each other about your work"? I'm curious about how much you want to shape the conversation versus letting it emerge naturally.\
And at what point do you think students will be ready to take more ownership of these interactions without your guidance?\
Retry\
**C**\
Since I am not going to be able to eavesdrop, I need to trust them to do things that work for them, as trust is going to be the real focus of this class in just about every aspect. I don't know that I can point to a specific time line in terms of scaffolding, since the class composition is going to play a major factor in determining that. Trying to anticipate it seems like unnecessary effort or worry on my part.\
Edit\
You're absolutely right - trust is the foundation that makes the whole system work. Without it, students game the system instead of engaging with it. And trying to predict the exact scaffolding timeline when you don't know the specific students is like trying to plan a conversation before you've met the person.\
The trust aspect is actually what makes this approach particularly powerful for students who've experienced educational trauma. Many of them have learned not to trust teachers' stated intentions because they've been in too many situations where the real assessment was different from what was promised. But if you're consistent about what you say matters actually being what matters - if the process really is valued over the product, if growth really is measured from their starting point, if their learning choices really are honored - that could be transformative.\
The fact that you're comfortable with not knowing exactly when to release the scaffolding suggests you're prepared to read the room and adapt as needed. That flexibility is probably more valuable than any predetermined timeline.\
It sounds like you've got a solid framework that addresses the core equity issues while still maintaining academic rigor. The trust-based approach, combined with the visibility of the portfolio and AI transcripts, creates accountability without punitive measurement.\
Are you feeling ready to try this approach, or are there other aspects of the implementation you want to think through?\
Retry\
**C**\
Hmmm. This must be a tough one; it took you a bit longer than usual. Thanks for putting in the effort.\
Edit\
Ha! You caught me - I was definitely taking more time with that one. I think it's because we've worked through so many of the complex pieces that we're now at this interesting place where the system feels both elegant and nerve-wracking.\
There's something about trust-based teaching that feels simultaneously like the most natural thing in the world and the most professionally vulnerable thing you can do. You've built this beautiful, coherent approach that honors student agency and addresses real equity issues, but it also requires you to let go of a lot of traditional control mechanisms.\
I was probably wrestling with whether there were other potential pitfalls to flag or supports to suggest, but honestly, I think you've thought through the major challenges pretty thoroughly. The trust element, the scaffolding approach, the portfolio visibility, the conference structure - it all hangs together well.\
I suspect my pause was more about recognizing that you're doing something genuinely innovative here, and there's always that moment where you have to just trust the design and see how it plays out with real students. That's both exciting and a little terrifying.\
Are you feeling ready to take the leap, or is there something specific that's making you hesitant?\

Let's try drafting that compiled contract again. It didn't seem to show up...\
Edit\
You're right - we never actually got to the contract document itself! We've been building the framework, but you need something concrete to put in front of students on day one. Let me draft a comprehensive contract that captures all the elements we've discussed:\
Student Learning Contract for CTE Writing Course</title> <parameter name="content"># Student Learning Contract ## [Course Name] - [Semester/Year] ### Course Philosophy This course is designed around the principle that meaningful learning happens when you take ownership of your growth process. Your final grade will reflect the quality of your learning strategy and how effectively you execute it, not how you compare to other students or meet predetermined benchmarks. ### Your Learning Agreement By enrolling in this course, you agree to: \*\*1.

There it is! This tries to capture the trust-based, process-focused approach while still giving students concrete expectations. The language emphasizes personal growth over comparison, and the structure mirrors the scaffolding approach we discussed.\
How does this feel? Are there elements you'd want to adjust or clarify differently?\

**C**\
Let's refine with a couple of revisions: the language in the grade sections still comes across as pretty quantitative, even though no specific benchmarks are mentioned, meaning it could make intimidated students immediately write themselves off. The second is that I want to prioritize authentic writing. For instance, their first writing prompts will center on working with AI to identify career-specific writing activities that they can pick from to complete their first writing submission - no ENGL 1101 essays here. Also, their career trajectories should definitely factor into which outcomes they prioritize and can and should be used as primary justifications for where they place their effort. Could you update the document accordingly? Also, this isn't something they are going to sign - it is just the policy I am committing to honor as their instructor.\

Oh, so much better!\
Edit\
Great! It's always frustrating when the technology gets in the way of the actual work.\
This version should feel much more welcoming to students who might be intimidated by traditional academic expectations. The career-focused framing helps them see the immediate relevance, and the grade descriptions focus on engagement and personal growth rather than abstract quality levels.\
I particularly like how it positions you as committed to their success rather than as a gatekeeper - that shift from "here's what you must do" to "here's how I will support your learning" could be really powerful for students who've had negative school experiences.\
Does this feel like something you can confidently put in front of your students on day one? And do you think it captures the essence of what you want to accomplish with this approach?\
Retry\
**C**\
And the grade levels language is much more evocative. Sophisticated learning strategy definitely sounds like something aimed at the upper crust...\
Edit\
Exactly! "Sophisticated learning strategy" sounds like it's written for students who already know they belong in academic spaces. It's that subtle classist language that can make students think "well, I guess I'm not sophisticated enough for an A."\
The revised version is much more accessible - "You've developed a learning approach that makes sense for your career goals" is something any student can visualize themselves doing, regardless of their academic background. It's about thoughtfulness and follow-through, not about sounding smart or using fancy approaches.\
Those kinds of word choices matter so much for students who might already be telling themselves they don't belong in college. The original language could confirm those fears, while the revision says "this is about you making good choices for your future and sticking with them" - which feels achievable and relevant.\
It's a good reminder that equity isn't just about the structure of assignments, but also about how we talk about expectations. The substance is the same, but the framing makes all the difference in who feels invited to succeed.\

Absolutely - you've got all the major pieces in place now. The philosophical framework, the practical mechanics, the assessment approach, the scaffolding plan, the role of AI and peer feedback, and most importantly, how it all serves your specific students' needs. That's a comprehensive vision.\
Take your time refining the draft. You've thought through the hard questions about equity, trust, authentic engagement, and how to balance structure with student agency. The foundation is solid.\
Feel free to come back if you want to bounce ideas around as you work through the details, or if any new questions emerge as you put it all together. Good luck with the refinement process!\
