# <a name="_5scz62naxi2c"></a>AI Conversation Daily Message Limit
Share\
**C**\
I was in the middle of a different conversation with you regarding a class I am desigining. I hit the daily message limit, though I was not aware there was one. I noted elsewhere that the daily limit resets every five hours or when a new conversation is created. Is there any way that the content already generated in the first conversation could be rolled over into the new conversation so we don't have to start over from scratch?\
Edit\
I don't have the ability to access or transfer content from previous conversations - each conversation with me starts fresh without any memory of past interactions. Unfortunately, there's no built-in way to automatically roll over content from one conversation to another.\
However, you can manually continue where you left off by:

1. Copy and paste key content from the previous conversation into this new one - you can paste the class design details, any artifacts I created, or the specific points we were discussing
1. Summarize the progress - give me a brief overview of what we accomplished and what you'd like to work on next
1. Share any artifacts - if I created any documents, code, or other content that you'd like to continue developing

Regarding the message limits, I don't have current information about the specific reset timing or policies for Claude's usage limits. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about message limits, pricing, and account features, I'd recommend checking [https://support.anthropic.com](https://support.anthropic.com/).\
Feel free to paste or describe what we were working on with your class design, and I'll be happy to pick up where we left off!\

Does that mean pasting the entirety of the original conversation is a possibility?\
Edit\
Yes, you can paste the entire original conversation if you'd like! I'll be able to read through it and understand the context of what we were working on together.\
A few things to keep in mind:

- I'll treat it as reference material - I'll read through the conversation history to understand where we left off, but I won't respond to every part of it, just use it to inform our continued work
- Focus on what's next - After pasting the conversation, let me know what specific aspect you'd like to continue working on or what the next steps should be
- Large conversations work fine - Even lengthy conversations can be pasted, though you might want to include a brief note about what you want to focus on moving forward

So go ahead and paste the conversation, and then tell me what you'd like to tackle next with your class design!\

Can conversations be downloaded into pdf format for easier contextualization?\
Edit\
I don't have specific information about whether the Claude web interface has a built-in feature to export conversations to PDF format. This would be a product feature question that I'm not equipped to answer definitively.\
For questions about specific features of the Claude application - like exporting conversations, downloading chat history, or other interface capabilities - I'd recommend checking [https://support.anthropic.com](https://support.anthropic.com/) where you can find the most current information about available features.\
In the meantime, if you need to preserve the conversation content, you could:

- Copy and paste the text into a document and save it as PDF
- Use your browser's print function to save the page as PDF (though formatting might vary)
- Take screenshots if the conversation includes visual elements

But for the official word on whether there's a built-in export feature, the support documentation would be your best resource.\
Would you like to go ahead and paste the conversation content here so we can continue working on your class design?\
