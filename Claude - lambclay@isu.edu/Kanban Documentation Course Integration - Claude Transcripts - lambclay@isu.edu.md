I need to integrate and customize the Kanban documentation to align with the course design attached here, specifically as it relates to the AI Prompts and the Self-Assessment process...\

Edit\
I'll help you integrate and customize the Kanban documentation by first examining the course design document you've shared, then creating an updated version that aligns with your specific AI prompts and self-assessment process.\

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of both your Kanban documentation and the course design. I can see how the course uses AI as a thinking partner, focuses on self-assessment, and has students work through their own ethical dilemmas using various frameworks. Let me create an integrated and customized version that aligns these two systems.\

This is creating far too complicated a system. If we create task cards to represent the different Parts outlined in the AI Prompts section, then the columns can be far less specific (To Do, In Progress, Blocked/Need Help, and Complete.\
Edit\
You're absolutely right. Let me simplify this to create a much cleaner, more usable system.\

Perfect! This simplified version focuses on the essential elements:\
Five clear task cards that match your course Parts 1-5, with four simple columns (To Do, In Progress, Blocked/Need Help, Complete) that any student can understand and use without overthinking.\
The key improvements:

- Eliminated overcomplicated workflow columns - just four basic stages everyone understands
- Focused on the actual course structure - cards match your AI prompts and course design
- Kept the essential integrations - AI checkpoints, self-assessment tagging, and evidence collection
- Made it actionable - clear examples and specific practices students can actually follow

This should be much more usable for students while still supporting the sophisticated learning goals of your course. The simplicity helps them focus on the intellectual work rather than managing a complex system.\

Much more better!\
Edit\
Excellent! I'm glad the simplified version hits the mark. Sometimes the best systems are the ones that get out of the way and let students focus on the actual learning rather than wrestling with overcomplicated processes.\
The beauty of this approach is that it maintains all the sophisticated elements your course needs—the AI integration, checkpoint management, self-assessment evidence collection—but packages it in a way that feels manageable and intuitive. Students can spend their mental energy on ethical reasoning rather than figuring out which of twelve columns to use!\
Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust or add to make this even more aligned with how you envision students using it?\
