I'll help you customize the Kanban system to align with your ethics course's archaeological approach and the specific parts outlined in your AI prompts. Here's a customized version:\

I've customized the Kanban system to align with your ethics course's unique archaeological approach. The key changes include:\
Terminology Shift: Changed from generic "writing project" language to "excavation" and "archaeological" terminology that matches your course metaphor.\
Course-Specific Cards: Mapped the six cards directly to your Parts 1-6 structure, from identifying the ethical dilemma through final self-assessment.\
Specialized Columns: Replaced generic writing workflow columns with excavation-specific phases like "Site Preparation," "Active Excavation," "Artifact Analysis," etc.\
Philosophical Focus: Reframed all documentation around discovering ethical reasoning patterns and philosophical foundations rather than writing development.\
AI Integration: Emphasized checkpoint preservation for maintaining excavation continuity, which is crucial given your course's heavy reliance on sustained AI collaboration.\
Assessment Alignment: The tagging system and reflection questions now directly support the learning dimensions you outlined in your self-assessment section (Ethical Excavation, Self-Awareness, Engagement, Risk-Taking, Use of AI).\
This system maintains the practical project management benefits while fully supporting your course's unique pedagogical approach of treating students as ethical archaeologists excavating their own philosophical foundations.\
