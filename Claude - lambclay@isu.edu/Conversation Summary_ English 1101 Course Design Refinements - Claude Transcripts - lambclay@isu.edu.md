# <a name="_3dhlvmr43fo8"></a>**Conversation Summary: English 1101 Course Design Refinements**
## <a name="_64fa8ye0mero"></a>**Key Decisions Made**
Portfolio Structure Simplified:

- Moved from single unwieldy Google Doc to organized Google Drive file hierarchy
- Structure: Course\_Info folder + 4 Assignment folders + AI\_Interactions folder
- AI interactions organized by date only (not by project) since students work on multiple assignments simultaneously

Daily Logging System:

- Google Form with standardized questions feeding into shared Google Sheet
- Eliminates consistency issues while capturing learning outcomes, AI use, and progress tracking
- Replaces need for individual daily reflection documents

Learning Contract & Breakthrough Tracking Innovation:

- Core insight: Created missing link between daily work and final grade recommendation
- Learning contracts based on strategic growth priorities (not comprehensive skill improvement)
- Breakthrough tracking triggered by "aha!" moments, not artificial weekly reports
- Contract can evolve as students discover their actual capacity vs. initial assumptions

The Breakthrough Tracking System:

- Google Form (not document) for capturing organic breakthrough moments
- Feeds into sortable/filterable Google Sheet for evidence building
- Organized around contract commitments rather than chronological entries
- Master form with all learning outcome areas supports contract evolution
## <a name="_zd1tst7z2f4g"></a>**Pedagogical Breakthrough**
Resolved core tension: Students must complete 4 assignments demonstrating all learning outcomes (non-negotiable), BUT can strategically focus growth energy on areas most relevant to their career goals. This works for both stronger students (sophisticated skill development) and developing students (foundational skill building).\
Process Flow Established:

1. Pre-course self-assessment
1. AI conference for contract planning
1. Instructor conference to approve contract
1. Ongoing breakthrough tracking via form
1. Final grade recommendation built from accumulated evidence
## <a name="_2erjsv5z6orj"></a>**Next Steps Identified**
- Self-assessment conference reminders/prompts for students
- Final form implementation in Google Forms
- Testing the complete system integration

The conversation successfully solved the "missing middle" problem - how students move from daily work to final grade justification through strategic, evidence-based growth tracking.\
