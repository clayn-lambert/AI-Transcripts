**C**\
I need to add two elements to this course and would like to discuss the best places to put this information, both so it is seen and understood by students, and so I know that it is part of the course design:\
\1) Students will be expected to copy and paste the entirety of every AI interaction into a Google Doc and store that in a shared folder with me\. This serves as a process for quantifying and validating their proper use of AI, and it will facilitate their finding artifacts and deep rich descriptions of their learning experience\.\
\2) A disclaimer that while much of the course content and documentation was developed through extensive interaction with AI, all the conceptualization, underlying theoretical framework, and course design was of my own creation and that I would be willing to make a record of this accessible if needed\.\
Here is the course documentation; please review where such notations would be most useful and then let's talk about what the actual language might look like?\

I'll review your course documentation to help you determine the best placement for these two important elements. Let me fetch the document first.\

Based on my review of your comprehensive course documentation, I can see this is a thoughtfully designed ethics course that uses AI as a thinking partner and emphasizes authentic engagement over traditional assessment. Here are my recommendations for where to place your two additions:
## <a name="_c4pm3kehcc7"></a>**Recommended Placements**
### <a name="_lrgqchfunsi5"></a>**1. AI Documentation Requirement (Copy/Paste All Interactions)**
Primary Location: In the "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner" section, specifically under "Maintaining Clear Records"\
This requirement fits perfectly with your existing checkpoint system. I suggest adding a dedicated subsection called something like "Complete Interaction Documentation" right after the checkpoint instructions.\
Secondary Mentions:

- A brief note in the course expectations/technical requirements section
- Reference it in each Part's AI prompt instructions
### <a name="_q0iovfr7wbb3"></a>**2. AI Development Disclaimer**
Primary Location: Early in the document - I'd suggest right after your opening Bertrand Russell quote and course introduction, before "Let's start with what we're actually doing"\
Alternative Location: In a new "Course Development and AI Use" section that could be placed just before the Table of Contents
## <a name="_94qv1p6kvhib"></a>**Suggested Language**
Let me draft some language options for each element:\
Proposed Language for AI Documentation Requirements\

\# AI Documentation Requirements - Language Options

\## 1. Complete AI Interaction Documentation

\### Option A (Direct/Procedural):\
\*\*Complete Interaction Documentation\*\*

In addition to creating checkpoints, you are required to maintain complete reco\
Now let's discuss the strategic placement and which language options work best for your course:\
For the AI Documentation Requirement:

- The procedural approach (Option A) fits well with your existing detailed instructions
- The values-based approach (Option B) aligns with your emphasis on authentic engagement
- The problem-solving approach (Option C) matches your practical, tool-focused tone

For the Disclaimer:

- Option A works if you want it to feel official and professional
- Option B feels more conversational and matches your approachable tone
- Option C ties directly into your course themes about ethical AI use
## <a name="_grbdow8ouo05"></a>**Questions for Refinement:**
1. Placement priority: Do you want the disclaimer to be very prominent (right after the opening) or more integrated into the course flow?
1. Tone matching: Which language style feels most authentic to your voice and course culture?
1. Student workload: The documentation requirement is significant - do you want to acknowledge this and explain why it's worth the effort?
1. Folder setup: Do you need specific instructions about setting up the shared Google Drive folder?

What are your thoughts on these options? I'm happy to refine any of these or explore different approaches based on what resonates with you.\
