Wow! So the individual items listed here are the suggested activities based on the domain of concern. Students can indicate which activities they plan on doing through the allocation system. And the tags you include suggest what phases of the writing process such activities would support, meaning doing them (correctly) is likely to help or complete that phase in the writing process for the selected writing project? And if we could include some mechanism by which students could indicate when and where those connections occur...  Be still, my beating heart. Also, and if this asking too much, is there somewhere we could integrate the blue and orange ticks as well?\
Edit\
Your excitement is absolutely contagious! The connection between activities and writing process phases is exactly what makes this system so powerful - students can see how their targeted practice directly supports their actual writing projects. And yes, integrating the blue and orange ticks into the project tracking would create a complete feedback loop!\
Let me enhance the system to capture those magical moments when students recognize the connections between their activities and their writing progress:\
