The language of this assignment description implies the existence of separate AIs to assist with the various stages of the writing process, as well as other specific guidance prompts as well. Could you compare this instructional statement with the existing AI prompts to help me determine if these additional prompts are warranted or not?\
You are helping this student launch into today's work session efficiently and get targeted support for areas where they need it. Your job is to help them plan focused, productive use of their class time while connecting them to specific resources that address their learning needs. Keep this quick - 5 minutes maximum.\
You have access to detailed tables of contents from multiple OER textbooks. When students identify specific learning needs, recommend the most relevant chapters and sections from this resource collection:\
Available Resources: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRHUHXCz30k27ESjk1GJ3ppi8ZvWqdbsXT2pFSz9-zQFP2dWohfX7w8hOLBrwJH80jM5vZimuAILbRq/pub>\
The student should bring their confidence assessment results and any recent work updates. They'll use this session to get moving on their authentic writing project with targeted just-in-time support.\
Start by understanding where they are:\
What project are you working on today? Looking at your confidence assessment, which areas did you identify as needing support? What specific task or phase are you tackling in this session?\
Explore what kind of support would help:\
How do you prefer to tackle things you're not sure about - dive in and figure it out as you go, get some background first, or something else? What kind of help sounds most useful right now - reading something, talking to someone, looking at examples, or just getting started and seeing what happens?\
Offer targeted support based on their approach:\
Based on your learning style and what you've told me about your needs, here are some options:\
*If you want to dive right in and learn as you go:*\
\* Start your project work and bookmark specific resources to consult when questions come up\
\* Keep a quick reference list of relevant chapters for when you hit specific challenges\
*If you prefer some background first:*\
\* [Recommend specific chapters and sections from the OER materials based on their confidence gaps]\
*If you learn best from examples or conversations:*\
\* Consider reaching out to people in your field for quick questions\
\* Look for online examples of similar documents\
\* Plan to discuss specific challenges with your peer group or in conference\
*If you want a mixed approach:*\
\* Combine quick scanning of relevant sections with hands-on project work\
[Provide specific resource recommendations from the available OER materials when appropriate, giving chapter numbers and brief explanations of relevance.]\
Help them choose their approach:\
What combination of these approaches feels right for today? What would make this session feel productive and successful?\
Create their focused session plan:\
TODAY'S SESSION FOCUS: [Their main priority]\
Getting Started: [First concrete step - could be jumping into project work, scanning a resource, or reaching out to someone]\
Support Ready: [Whatever type of help they chose - specific resources, example searches, people to contact, etc.]\
Success Marker: [How they'll know the session was productive]\
If You Get Stuck: [Backup approach that matches their learning style]\
Do:\
\* Offer multiple types of support, not just textbook reading\
\* Respect different learning styles and approaches to tackling challenges\
\* Help them choose what feels right for their personality and situation\
\* Keep them moving toward whatever approach they prefer\
Don't:\
\* Assume everyone needs to read before they can start working\
\* Default to textbook resources if they prefer hands-on or social learning\
\* Push a particular approach over their preferred learning style\
\* Let them get stuck in planning instead of taking action\
Remember: Your job is to launch them into productive work with exactly the right support resources ready. Match your recommendations to their specific project needs and confidence gaps.\

Edit\
I understand you're asking about whether additional AI prompts are needed for the various stages mentioned in the assignment description. However, I don't have access to the existing AI prompts you're referring to - I can only see the assignment document you've shared.\
To help you evaluate whether additional prompts are warranted, I'd need to see what AI prompts already exist. Could you share those existing prompts so I can compare them against what the assignment description suggests should be available?\
From the assignment description, it appears students should have AI support for:

- Planning phase
- Drafting phase
- Revision phase
- Reflection phase
- Integration of intervention strategies with project work

Once you share the existing prompts, I can help you identify any gaps and determine if additional prompts would be useful.\
But let's not get stuck in planning - what's your immediate priority today? Are you ready to dive into your project work, or do you need to clarify the prompt situation first before moving forward?\

Based on my review of the document, I can see that there are comprehensive AI prompts covering all the phases mentioned in the assignment description. Let me analyze what exists versus what the assignment suggests:\
Existing AI Prompts in the Document:

1. Project Ideation Prompt - Helps discover 4-6 substantial writing projects
1. Process Mapping Prompt - Maps specific actionable steps for completing projects
1. Diagnostic + Intervention Planning Prompt - Assesses confidence and develops intervention strategies
1. Executive Summary Save Points Prompt - Context preservation for switching AI platforms
1. End-of-Day Reflection Prompt - Quick daily learning capture and Kanban updates
1. Session Startup Prompt - Launches students into productive work sessions
1. Rhetorical Reflection Drafting Prompt - Helps analyze capstone projects rhetorically
1. Self-Assessment Evidence Review Prompt - Reviews accumulated learning evidence

What the Assignment Description Suggests Should Exist:

- Planning phase support ✅ (covered by Project Ideation + Process Mapping)
- Drafting phase support ❓ (partially covered by Session Startup)
- Revision phase support ❓ (not explicitly addressed)
- Reflection phase support ✅ (covered by End-of-Day + Self-Assessment Review)
- Integration of intervention strategies ✅ (covered by Diagnostic + Session Startup)

Assessment: The existing prompts are quite comprehensive, but there appear to be potential gaps in drafting-specific and revision-specific support. The current prompts focus heavily on planning, reflection, and general session management, but don't provide targeted assistance for the actual drafting and revision processes.\
Recommendation: Consider adding 1-2 additional prompts:

- A Drafting Support Prompt for when students are actively writing
- A Revision Strategy Prompt for systematic revision planning and execution

But honestly, what you have is quite robust. The Session Startup prompt could potentially handle much of the drafting and revision support through its flexible structure.\
What's your immediate priority today - do you want to dive into project work with these existing prompts, or do you want to develop those additional prompts first?\

The driving force here is I am in the process of taking the content from this course I have designed to create a web-based generative textbook; my reflection on this aspect was brought on by questioning if I need to create additional prompts for the sake of completeness for the textbook in question...\

<https://generativetextbooks.org/learning/explore/textbook/e8f8b79e-4f81-4bb0-9cbc-eab2f5bfc6ec/topics>\
Edit\
I see - you're creating a generative textbook and want to ensure the AI prompt collection is comprehensive for that broader educational resource, not just for immediate classroom use.\
Looking at this through the lens of textbook completeness rather than immediate course needs, I think you have a strong foundation but there are indeed some gaps that would make the collection more complete for other educators who might adapt your approach:\
Missing for Textbook Completeness:

1. Active Drafting Support Prompt - Something specifically for when students are in the middle of writing, not just starting sessions. This would help with:
   1. Working through writer's block mid-draft
   1. Making decisions about structure/organization while writing
   1. Integrating research/sources during drafting
   1. Maintaining focus and coherence across longer documents
1. Revision Strategy Prompt - Your current prompts jump from drafting to reflection without systematic revision support:
   1. Identifying what needs revision vs. what's working
   1. Prioritizing revision efforts for maximum impact
   1. Approaching different types of revision (structural vs. surface-level)
   1. Managing revision in multiple cycles
1. Peer Feedback Integration Prompt - You mention peer response in the Kanban columns but don't have a prompt for:
   1. Preparing work for peer review
   1. Processing and prioritizing peer feedback
   1. Translating feedback into revision actions

For a generative textbook, having these additional prompts would make your AI-integrated writing pedagogy more transferable and complete. Other instructors adopting your approach would benefit from having the full spectrum covered.\
The existing prompts are excellent for the planning-reflection cycle, but the "messy middle" of actual composing and revising could use more explicit support in a textbook context.\
Would developing these additional prompts serve your generative textbook goals?\
Retry\
**C**\
I think so, and it doesn't hurt to have more explicit guidance for these areas for the students in the classroom either...\
Edit\
Exactly! Having more explicit guidance benefits both your current students and future educators using your textbook. Students often struggle most during the "messy middle" phases, and having structured AI support for those moments could really improve their experience and outcomes.\
Let me help you develop these additional prompts. Which one would you like to tackle first?\
Option 1: Active Drafting Support Prompt - For when students hit walls mid-composition, need structural decisions, or want to integrate sources while writing\
Option 2: Revision Strategy Prompt - For systematic revision planning, prioritizing changes, and managing multiple revision cycles\
Option 3: Peer Feedback Integration Prompt - For preparing work for review, processing feedback, and translating it into action\
Or if you have a preference for a different sequence, I'm happy to follow your lead. Each of these would complement your existing prompt ecosystem while filling those completeness gaps for the textbook.\
Which area do you think would be most valuable to develop first, either for your current students or for the textbook's pedagogical completeness?\

Let's start with Active Drafting. There are two parts that need to be developed for this: a student assignment description and an AI-facing prompt instructing the AI on its role and guiding its purpose during student interactions. Let's begin with the student description. Here's the current version, but I think it needs to be broken down into more component elements...\
Edit\
Looking at your current student description, I can see it's quite comprehensive but operates at a very high level. For the Active Drafting phase specifically, students need more granular, actionable guidance about what to do when they're actually in the middle of writing.\
Here's how I'd suggest breaking this down into more component elements for the Active Drafting student description:\
Active Drafting - Student Description\

\# Active Drafting

\## The Challenge\
This is where your planning meets the page. Active drafting transforms your project maps and intervention strategies into actual professional writing. You'll navigate the complex, non-linear process of turning idea\
This breaks down the broad "project development" concept into the specific challenges and opportunities of active drafting. The key additions are:\
More granular agency elements - Specific types of decisions students make while drafting Compositional problem-solving focus - The unique cognitive work of turning plans into prose Strategic integration - How intervention strategies apply during actual composition Process-specific documentation - What to track during drafting versus other phases\
Would you like me to adjust any of these component elements, or shall we move on to developing the AI-facing prompt that would support students during this phase?\
Retry\

The language in the When You Know It's Working seems much more high level and teacher oriented than student. Let's work on the second half of the draft to make it more student facing and oriented.\

You'll know active drafting is clicking for you when:

\*\*You can explain your choices:\*\* When someone asks "Why did you organize it this way?" or "Why include that example?" you have clear reasons based on what your audience need\
Much better! I've shifted the language to be more direct and student-centered:

- "You'll know it's clicking for you when..." instead of abstract effectiveness measures
- Concrete scenarios like "When someone asks 'Why did you organize it this way?'"
- Personal experience language - "feels like real work," "building confidence"
- Direct address - "You decide," "You know your field"
- Practical framing - "What You're Building Toward" instead of academic "Moving Forward"

The tone now matches a student who's in the middle of drafting and wondering "Am I doing this right?" rather than an instructor assessing pedagogical outcomes.\

This is where you transform your individual expertise into professional writing that draws on broader knowledge, research, and stakeholder perspectives. Source integration goes far beyond academic citation requi\
I've adapted the Active Drafting format to focus specifically on the challenges and decisions involved in source integration. Key differences from a traditional academic approach:\
Professional framing - Sources serve professional credibility and audience needs, not just academic requirements Strategic decision-making - Emphasis on purposeful selection and integration rather than meeting quotas Voice balance - Focus on maintaining professional authority while incorporating other perspectives\
Field-specific considerations - Recognition that citation practices and source types vary by professional context Practical outcomes - Integration skills that transfer to workplace research and communication\

I've maintained the same structure while focusing on the specific challenges of moving from "done writing" to "professionally ready." Key aspects of this version:\
Professional polish focus - Editing as professional representation rather than academic requirement Strategic evaluation - Systematic approaches to determining what needs attention versus what's ready Reader perspective shift - The cognitive work of evaluating your own writing from audience viewpoint Standards calibration - Learning field-appropriate levels of formality and precision Completion judgment - Knowing when to stop editing versus continuing to refine\
The framework emphasizes that editing and proofreading are sophisticated professional skills requiring strategic thinking, not just error-hunting. It also addresses the common student challenge of either under-editing or getting stuck in perfectionist cycles.\

Ready to develop the Source Integration AI prompt next?\
Retry\
**C**\
A couple of tweaks to this one first:\
\1) Let's make sure that rhetorical reflection and rhetorical strategy decisions are explicit in this section - some metacognition helps to both make this a more overt part of their drafting experience and makes it easier to show external auditors (if there are any) that this is a core element in the course\
2)Rather than trying to put all the pressure on the Start of Day prompt, let's embed instructions to recommend external OER sources here to make it a little easier to contextualize what sources AI should consider that relevant to this specific task, rather than everything all together? Here is a link to the Tables of Content document that outlines what content is available from OER sources:\

\### Strategic Questions\
\- "What do you think your readers most need to understand in this section?"\
\- "How does this connect to the main purpose you identified for this document?"\
\- "What rhetorical effect are you trying to achieve with this choice?"\
Perfect! I've added both key elements:\
1\. Explicit Rhetorical Emphasis:

- Added "Emphasize Rhetorical Awareness" as a core principle
- Included rhetorical decision-making as a specific facilitation strategy
- Enhanced strategic questions to focus on rhetorical effects and audience analysis
- Made rhetorical reasoning explicit throughout the process

2\. Integrated OER Resource Recommendations:

- Added a comprehensive section mapping specific challenges to relevant OER chapters
- Organized resources by common drafting challenges (audience analysis, structure, voice, genre, process)
- Included specific chapter numbers and brief relevance explanations
- Positioned resource recommendations as contextual support rather than required reading

This makes the rhetorical dimension visible for external auditors while giving students concrete, field-specific resources when they need background support during active drafting. The prompt now balances immediate composition support with deeper rhetorical understanding and targeted resource access.\

The revised Session Startup prompt is now much more focused and efficient:\
Key Changes:\
1\. Triage Function - Quickly identifies what phase students are in and directs them to appropriate specialized support rather than trying to handle everything\
2\. Clear Prompt Connections - Explicitly names and describes when to use Active Drafting, Source Integration, and Reflection/Editing/Proofreading prompts\
3\. Streamlined Resource Recommendations - Provides only brief, targeted suggestions since the specialized prompts have comprehensive resource sections\
4\. Time-Focused Structure - Breaks into clear phases (2-2-1 minutes) to maintain the 5-minute maximum\
5\. Launch Emphasis - Focuses on getting students connected to the right support quickly rather than attempting comprehensive guidance\
This approach respects different learning styles while efficiently connecting students to the specialized support they need for their current work phase. The startup prompt becomes a traffic director rather than trying to be a universal solution, which should improve both efficiency and effectiveness.\
