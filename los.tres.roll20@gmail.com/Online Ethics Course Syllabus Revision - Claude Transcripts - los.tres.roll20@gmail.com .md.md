Share\
**C**\
I have done significant revision and created a completely new version of a postsecondary ethics course designed for asynchronous online learners. Here is a web published version of the landing page and syllabus:\
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRrZbgu0x2VjOBtYuzWdONd_odduJd7nFU1fdS_FLWlLkkWVqB0TTCanqtD_qxKIdxti2bHTSI79xmc/pub>\
Right now, I am looking at individual panels to improve continuity and internal cohesion, specifically around the extended analogy of ethics as archeology and removing other metaphors, like algorithms, operating systems, etc. I'd now like to look at the How To... page. In a previous chat, it was decided to eliminate the Working With AI as a separate panel. The Why AI section was folded into the Course Foundations panel, and I would like to move the other recommendation elements from that page into the How To... panel for more consistency. Could you make these revisions and show me a suggested draft that uses the same table of contents and internal navigation elements as present in the current version?\
Edit\
I'll help you revise the "How To..." page by incorporating the AI recommendation elements and maintaining consistency with your archaeology metaphor. Let me first fetch the current document to understand the existing structure and content.\

I apologize, but I'm unable to directly fetch the Google Docs URL you provided. However, I can help you create a revised "How To..." page that incorporates the AI recommendation elements while maintaining consistency with your archaeology metaphor.\
Could you please:

1. Copy and paste the current "How To..." page content, or
1. Provide the specific AI recommendation content from the previous "Working With AI" panel that needs to be integrated

This will allow me to create a cohesive revision that maintains your table of contents structure and internal navigation elements while eliminating mixed metaphors and strengthening the archaeology theme throughout the course materials.\
Once I have this content, I can create a comprehensive draft that seamlessly integrates the AI recommendations into the "How To..." framework while maintaining the archaeological excavation metaphor you've established for the ethics course.\

Perfect! I can see the document now. I can see this is a comprehensive ethics course with an extensive "How To..." section that includes guidance on working with AI. Based on your request to integrate the AI recommendation elements and maintain consistency with your archaeology metaphor, I'll create a revised "How To..." page that:

1. Incorporates AI guidance seamlessly into the existing structure
1. Eliminates mixed metaphors (like "algorithms," "operating systems")
1. Strengthens the archaeology metaphor throughout
1. Maintains the same table of contents and internal navigation

I'll help you revise the "How To..." page by incorporating the AI recommendation elements and maintaining consistency with your ethics as archaeology extended analogy. Let me first fetch the current document to understand the structure and content.\

Now I can see the current structure. I notice this appears to be focused on practical "how-to" guidance for AI tools and ClickUp project management. To better understand what content needs to be moved from the "Working With AI" section, could you clarify what specific AI recommendation elements you'd like me to incorporate?\
However, based on what I can see, I'll create a revised version that:

1. Maintains the current table of contents and navigation structure
1. Integrates the AI guidance more cohesively
1. Removes non-archaeology metaphors (I can see references to "save points in a game" and "algorithms")
1. Strengthens the archaeology metaphor throughout

I've revised the "How To..." page to integrate the AI guidance more seamlessly while maintaining your ethics-as-archaeology extended analogy throughout. Here are the key changes I made:\
Strengthened the archaeology metaphor:

- AI is now consistently framed as an "archaeological research assistant" and "collaborative partner" in excavation
- Checkpoints are reframed as "excavation field notes" and "daily dig reports"
- ClickUp columns are described as "excavation phases"
- Work sessions are "archaeological investigations"
- Problems become "stuck excavations" needing guidance

Removed incompatible metaphors:

- Eliminated "save points in a game" reference
- Removed algorithm/operating system language
- Replaced technical terminology with archaeological language

Maintained structure and navigation:

- Kept all original table of contents sections
- Preserved the ↑ Back to Top navigation system
- Maintained the troubleshooting format and specific problem/solution pairs

Enhanced AI guidance integration:

- Expanded the AI tools section to include privacy and tool selection considerations
- Strengthened the productive conversations section with more specific archaeological framing
- Enhanced the checkpoint sections to emphasize their role in maintaining excavation continuity

The revision maintains the practical, hands-on tone while ensuring all guidance supports students in viewing their ethical work as a systematic archaeological investigation rather than a technical process.\

Can we now look at the AI Prompts section, and look for inconsistencies, echoes from previous iterations of the course design, ghost echoes or references to items not mentioned elsewhere in the course and for overall tone, style, and internal cohesion?\
Edit\
I'd be happy to review the AI Prompts section for inconsistencies, outdated references, and cohesion issues. However, I don't see that section in the document you shared earlier. Could you either:

1. Provide a link to the document containing the AI Prompts section, or
1. Share the content of that section directly

Once I can access the AI Prompts content, I'll analyze it for:

- Inconsistencies with the ethics-as-archaeology framework
- Ghost echoes from previous course iterations (like algorithm/operating system metaphors)
- Orphaned references to content that no longer exists in the course
- Tone and style alignment with the rest of the course materials
- Internal cohesion within the prompts themselves
- Continuity with the revised "How To..." section we just worked on

I'll also check that the prompts support students in approaching their work as systematic ethical archaeologists rather than using incompatible metaphors from earlier course designs.\
