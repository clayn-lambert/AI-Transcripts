I have a course landing page in Canvas that feels like it's a Frankenstein's monster of mixed voice, redundant content, and gaps in coverage . I'd like to upload elements for you to see what I am trying to create and then help me improve the consistency, internal structure, reduce repetiveness, maintain a consistent voice and tone, and just make the document work better. The document is essentially one long page, but is displayed within Canvas as different HTML panels with tabs to move among the pages. I have a generalized walkthrough video already created that introduces the tabs, but is generic enough that it wouldn't need to be revised unless there are massive changes proposed after our review.\
Edit\
I'd be happy to help you refine your Canvas course landing page! Based on the ethics course content you've shared, I can already see you have a clear, engaging voice that balances academic rigor with practical accessibility. The "ethics as algorithm" framing is particularly compelling.\
To give you the most targeted feedback, could you upload the current Canvas content elements? I'm looking for:

1. The existing landing page content (all tabs/panels)
1. Any specific sections you're most concerned about
1. The intended audience and course level (if different from what I can infer)

Once I can see the full scope, I can help you:

- Streamline redundancies while preserving key concepts
- Establish consistent voice and tone throughout all sections
- Improve logical flow and internal structure
- Identify and fill any content gaps
- Ensure each tab has a clear, distinct purpose

From what you've shared so far, your foundation is strong—the writing is clear, the examples are concrete, and the approach is refreshingly practical. The main task will likely be architectural: making sure each section serves a distinct purpose and the overall structure guides students logically through your course concepts.\
Go ahead and upload whatever elements you'd like me to review, and I'll provide specific suggestions for improvement.\

Let's look at all the elements first, just to keep my use of tokens as efficient as possible, okay?\
The Wreck Room\
*“In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.”* – Bertrand Russell\
📘 Table of Contents\

What Is the Wreck Room?\
The Wreck Room is a special segment in our weekly podcast where one Honors student takes the spotlight—not to explain or apply a model, but to test its limits.\
This is your chance to step into the role of ethical stress-tester. We’re not here to dunk on the model or dismiss it; we’re here to identify what it hides, what it avoids, and what it struggles to address. It’s about thinking beyond mastery and toward critique.\
↑ Back to Top\
What Honors Students Do\
Each Honors student will lead two Wreck Room segments across the semester. These segments follow an ethical model of their choice and should:\
\* Raise a significant tension, contradiction, or omission within the model\
\* Articulate the risk or cost of using that model in a real ethical situation\
\* Pose an open-ended question that invites further inquiry\
These are not debates or takedowns. Think of them as diagnostics—we're checking for weaknesses before applying the model to something serious. And perhaps suggesting resolutions or solutions for those concerns...\
You’ll have the freedom to follow your own interests and philosophical leanings. Just make sure your segment pushes the model to reveal something new, unstable, or unspoken.\
↑ Back to Top\
Why It Matters for Everyone\
The Wreck Room isn’t just for Honors students. It’s a shared intellectual resource for the entire class.\
Every time you listen to a segment, you’ll hear a model under pressure. Sometimes it’ll hold. Sometimes it won’t. Either way, the friction reveals blind spots, shaky foundations, or contradictions you might miss in a cleaner application.\
Good ethical thinking isn’t just about using models well. It’s about recognizing when they break down. The Wreck Room shows that in real time.\
↑ Back to Top\
Conflict Maps and Wreck Room Integration\
Wreck Room segments might be optional content for some of you, but they can be incredibly useful as you develop your Conflict Maps. Here’s how you might use them:\
\* In Your Own Work (Honors students): If your Wreck Room segment uncovered a blind spot in the model, you’re encouraged to reference it in your map. This can look like: *“As I noted in my Wreck Room segment, this model struggles with questions of autonomy when cultural values conflict.”*\
\* In Any Student’s Work: If a peer’s Wreck Room segment challenged your thinking, feel free to name it. This is a high-level engagement move. Example: *“The critique raised by Jamie in Week 6 helped me realize that this model's emphasis on utility can suppress marginalized voices.”*\
\* In Self-Assessment: Thoughtful integration of Wreck Room ideas (not name-dropping, but genuine synthesis) will often reflect well in your self-evaluation. This isn't going to work as a self-assessment shortcut—it’s just one way to show what deeper thinking looks like.\
You're not required to track every segment, but the more you weave these critiques into your thinking, the more dynamic your ethical reasoning becomes.\
↑ Back to Top\
Calendar & Assignments\
You’ll be assigned to two models over the course of the semester. These dates will be visible on the shared Wreck Room calendar in the main Course Hub. Assignments are roughly every 4–5 weeks, and you’ll never have two segments back-to-back.\
If you want to propose a swap or request a specific model based on your interests, just reach out in the first two weeks.\
↑ Back to Top\
Edit\
Perfect! Now I can see the full scope. You have four main sections:

1. Course Philosophy & Project Overview (first two documents)
1. Self-Assessment Guide (third document)
1. Wreck Room (Honors component)

I can see the issues clearly now:\
Main Problems:

- Redundant explanations of what ethics is/isn't between documents
- Inconsistent terminology ("Conflict Map" vs "Project Document")
- Different organizational structures across sections
- Varying levels of formality and tone
- Some content gaps and unclear connections between components

Strengths to Preserve:

- Clear, accessible voice throughout
- Strong "ethics as algorithm" framing
- Practical, authentic approach
- Good balance of structure and flexibility

Let me create a streamlined, cohesive version that maintains your excellent content while fixing the structural and consistency issues. Should I create one comprehensive landing page that integrates all elements, or would you prefer to keep them as separate tabs but with consistent voice and cross-references?\
Also, I noticed the self-assessment mentions "ClickUp board" while the main content references "kanban board" - should I standardize this terminology?\

How-To Guide\
This guide gives you step-by-step instructions for using the tools in this class—especially ClickUp and your AI assistant. You’ll learn how to create, organize, and update your ClickUp tasks, and how to interact effectively with AI agents.\

ClickUp: What You Need to Know\
ClickUp is the main project management tool we’ll use to keep track of your ethics work. You’ll be invited to join a shared public board with all class members. Each major assignment or “Part” in this course will have its own task card. As you work, you’ll move your tasks through status columns to show your progress.\
\* Task Cards: Represent Parts 1–5 of your project.\
\* Columns: To-Do, In Progress, Blocked / Need Help, Complete.\
\* Subtasks: Track work sessions for each Part.\
\* Assignments: Cards are assigned to individuals to make them private to you and the instructor.\
Back to Top ↑\
ClickUp Setup: How to Get Started\
1\. Accept Your Invitation\
You’ll receive an email invitation to join the shared class ClickUp board. Click the link and sign in with your student email address. If you don’t have an account, it will prompt you to create one.\
2\. Locate Your Task Cards\
Once inside the board, look for cards labeled Part 1, Part 2, Part 3... through Part 5. These are the major project stages you'll complete during the semester. Each card will be assigned to you, which makes your work visible only to you and the instructor.\
3\. Understand the Columns\
Each task moves through the columns as your work progresses:\
\* To-Do: You haven’t started this Part yet.\
\* In Progress: You’re actively working on this Part.\
\* Blocked / Need Help: You’re stuck and need instructor guidance.\
\* Complete: You’ve submitted and reflected on this Part.\
Back to Top ↑\
How to Use ClickUp Effectively\
Creating a Task Card (if needed)\
1\. Click the + New Task button.\
2\. Name your task something like Part 3 – Role Analysis.\
3\. Assign it to yourself so only you and the instructor can view it.\
4\. Select the appropriate status column (e.g., To-Do).\
Moving a Card to a New Column\
1\. Click and hold your task card.\
2\. Drag it to the next status column (e.g., from “To-Do” to “In Progress”).\
3\. Release to drop it into place.\
Adding a Subtask for a Work Session\
1\. Open your main task card (e.g., Part 2).\
2\. Click + Subtask.\
3\. Give it a title like Brainstorming ethical stakeholders – July 31.\
4\. Repeat this whenever you work on that Part. Try to add at least one subtask per week (by Sunday), or more often as needed.\
Marking a Task as Blocked\
1\. Drag your card into the Blocked / Need Help column.\
2\. Optionally, add a comment explaining the issue so the instructor can respond more quickly.\
Back to Top ↑\
AI Agent Basics\
You are free to use any platform-agnostic AI assistant (such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity) during this course. You’ll interact with your chosen AI to help you analyze dilemmas, reflect on your thinking, and test ideas from different ethical frameworks.\
Important: The AI doesn’t have memory between sessions. If you want to preserve your progress, you’ll need to create and paste back in checkpoints (see the “Why AI?” tab).\
Back to Top ↑\
Best Practices for Interacting with AI\
\* Be clear about your goals. Tell the AI what you’re trying to do.\
\* Talk through your ideas, not just ask for answers.\
\* Use checkpoints every 8–10 turns to save progress.\
\* Keep AI responses focused—don’t let it wander or overgeneralize.\
\* If confused, ask the AI to restate or simplify its explanation.\
\* Paste previous checkpoints into a new session to restore context.\

Since the class is fully online asynchronous, I won't have the opportunity to walk students through this content face to face. I'd prefer to keep elements more compartmentalized, using panels, rather than a one long document with internal links approach. Does that work for you?\
Edit\
Absolutely! That makes much more sense for an asynchronous online environment. Students need to be able to access specific information quickly without scrolling through a massive document.\
Let me create separate, focused panels that work as standalone pieces while maintaining consistency across all of them. Each panel should:

- Be self-contained and immediately useful
- Have a consistent voice and terminology
- Cross-reference other panels when relevant
- Be scannable for busy students

Would you like me to create them as separate artifacts (one per panel), or would you prefer them organized in a single artifact with clear panel breaks that you can copy/paste into Canvas?\
Also, what's your preferred order for the panels? I'm thinking:

1. Course Philosophy (the "why" and foundational concepts)
1. Your Conflict Map Project (the main deliverable)
1. Progress Tracking with ClickUp (the tools)
1. AI as Thinking Partner (the process support)
1. Podcasts & Peer Learning (community element)
1. Self-Assessment (evaluation approach)
1. The Wreck Room (Honors component)

That works. In terms of tone, I like the Wreck Room tone the best. Could we strive to integrate that style into all the pages?\

Perfect! I've integrated the concept of heuristics alongside algorithms. The definition positions heuristics as practical shortcuts and rules of thumb that complement the more systematic algorithmic thinking - which should work well as you reference both concepts throughout the other panels.\
