I've created a comprehensive archaeological excavation prompt for Chapter 9 on Simone de Beauvoir's existentialist feminism, following the exact structure and style of your examples.\
The prompt maintains the same:

- Archaeological metaphor throughout (excavation, mining, digging)
- Three-step structure (Read & React, AI Interview, Document Findings)
- Emphasis on personal discovery rather than theory summary
- Specific excavation questions tied to de Beauvoir's key concepts
- Deep dig options for students to choose from
- Detailed documentation requirements with conflict map annotations
- Encouraging tone that validates all discoveries

Key de Beauvoirian concepts integrated:

- "The Other" and othering dynamics
- Social construction of gender/identity
- Immanence vs. transcendence
- Existential freedom and authenticity
- Ethics of ambiguity
- Equality vs. difference feminism tensions
- Intersectionality foundations

The prompt encourages students to discover how they already think about social construction, othering, authentic existence, and the complexity of identity formation in their own moral reasoning, while using AI as their "excavation assistant."\
