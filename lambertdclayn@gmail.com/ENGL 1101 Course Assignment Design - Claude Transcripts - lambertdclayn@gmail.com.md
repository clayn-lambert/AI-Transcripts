Excavating Your Ethical Reasoning Process Throughout the semester, you'll develop one integrated project that evolves as your thinking develops about your own ethical decision-making patterns and the frameworks that can inform them. This isn't a traditional sequence of separate assignments—it's a c\

Using the following section from an ethics course as a guide, help me create the individual assignment descriptions for an ENGL 1101 course using the following syllabus as a reference:\

Now I have a clear understanding of your ENGL 1101 course structure. I can see how the ethics course's "archaeological excavation" approach to personal development can be adapted to professional writing skill development. Let me create individual assignment descriptions that mirror the ethics course format while serving your composition goals.\

I've created individual assignment descriptions that mirror the structure and approach of your ethics course materials while focusing on professional writing development rather than ethical reasoning. The assignments maintain:\
Structural Elements from the Ethics Course:

- The same 6-part progression building on each previous phase
- Clear articulation of student agency and decision-making authority
- Honest acknowledgment of expected difficulties as learning indicators
- Emphasis on documentation and evidence-building throughout
- Self-assessment as the culminating demonstration of growth
- "Trust the process" messaging for handling discomfort and uncertainty

Adaptations for ENGL 1101:

- Focus on authentic professional writing projects rather than personal ethical dilemmas
- Process mapping and diagnostic assessment instead of heuristics discovery
- Barrier analysis and intervention planning rather than conflict mapping
- Professional writing development through real projects rather than philosophical framework exploration
- Capstone integration rather than philosophical investigation
- Career-relevant skill development throughout

The assignments align with your syllabus approach of:

- Student-directed project selection
- AI as thinking partner with specific prompts
- Systematic skill development targeting actual barriers
- Professional writing that serves career goals
- Self-assessment based on documented growth
- Integration of development work with authentic communication challenges

Each part maintains the same tone and approach as your ethics course while serving the composition requirements and professional development goals outlined in your syllabus.\
