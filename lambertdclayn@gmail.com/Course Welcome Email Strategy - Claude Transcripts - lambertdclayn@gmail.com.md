The class begins a week from today and is already been published for enrolled users. I would like to design a welcome email that highlights the critical knowledge or insight students might need to introduce them to the course, without overwhelming them with a fire hose of new info. What would you suggest I include?\

I'll help you design an effective welcome email for your course. Let me first take a look at the course document you've shared to understand the content and structure.\

Based on your course document "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner," I can see this is a sophisticated ethics course that uses AI as a collaborative tool for exploring ethical dilemmas. Here's my suggestion for a welcome email that introduces the critical knowledge without overwhelming students:\

\# Welcome to "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner"

Dear Students,

Welcome to what promises to be a unique and personally meaningful semester! Classes begin in just one week, and I wanted to share three essential insights that will set you up f\
This welcome email focuses on the three most critical concepts students need to understand before starting:

1. The personal nature of the work - This isn't theoretical; they need to choose something that genuinely matters to them
1. How AI actually functions in the course - As a thinking partner with practical checkpoint management
1. The unique assessment approach - Self-assessment based on documented growth rather than traditional grading

The email also includes a gentle acknowledgment that this approach may feel unfamiliar while reassuring students they have support. It ends with practical next steps they can take immediately.\
Would you like me to adjust the tone, add any specific course logistics, or modify any particular section?\

Add some references to the fact that it is an online asynchronous course, which might have some students feeling lost or alone, and that it is very easy to forget to keep up with online courses, so I have tried to anticipate and design around those concerns.\

\## Staying Connected in an Online Course

I know online asynchronous courses can feel isolating, and it's remarkably easy to fall behind when there aren't regular class meetings to keep you on track. I've designed this course specifically to address\
Perfect! I've added a dedicated section that directly addresses the online asynchronous format challenges. The additions:

1. Acknowledge the isolation concern - Explicitly recognize that online courses can feel lonely and it's easy to fall behind
1. Highlight community features - Emphasize how peer podcasts create authentic connection
1. Explain the support systems - Show how ClickUp and AI prompts provide structure and accountability
1. Add practical advice - Include scheduling weekly self check-ins as a concrete strategy for staying on track
1. Demonstrate instructor awareness - Let students know you understand the typical challenges and have designed solutions

The revised email now better prepares students for the online format while maintaining focus on the essential course concepts. It should help students feel more confident about succeeding in an asynchronous environment.\

Just as a side note, what is it in this course syllabi that prompts you to label the course as Welcome to "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner", rather than TGE 1257 - Ethics in Applied Technology?\
Edit\
You raise an excellent point about course identification! Looking back at the document, I can see why this happened:\
The document opens with "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner" as the main heading, which reads like a course title. This prominent placement made it seem like the primary course identifier.\
However, you're absolutely right that this appears to be the course theme or approach rather than the actual course title. The formal course designation "TGE 1257 - Ethics in Applied Technology" isn't prominently displayed in the document I reviewed, so I defaulted to what appeared to be the "title."\
This is a good reminder that syllabi often lead with pedagogical approaches or course themes before stating the formal course information. Would you like me to update the welcome email to use the correct course title "TGE 1257 - Ethics in Applied Technology" instead?\
It's also worth noting that students will likely connect more with "Working with AI as Your Thinking Partner" as a description of what they'll be doing, even if that's not the official course name. I could incorporate both - the formal title for clarity and the thematic description for engagement.\
