I would like to create specific bibliographies based on the sample listed above using the references and chapters included in the google doc. I don't want to immediately start creating them, but I would like to give you the general information to access first.\
Edit\
I understand you'd like me to access the Google Doc to review the references and chapters it contains, so I can help you create specific bibliographies based on the sample format you've provided. Let me fetch that document for you.\

Fetched Ethics Texts\
google.com\
Perfect! I've accessed the Google Doc and can see the comprehensive list of ethics texts and their respective chapters. The document contains references from several open access ethics textbooks, including:

1. Byars & Stanberry - Business Ethics (OpenStax)
1. Meynell & Paron - Applied Ethics Primer
1. Matthews & Hendricks - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics
1. Gomez - Introduction to Ethics (El Paso Community College/Lumen Learning)
1. Fisher, Dimmock, & Imler - Phronesis: An Open Ethics Primer

Each source includes multiple chapters covering topics like:

- Virtue ethics (ancient and modern)
- Utilitarianism
- Deontological ethics (Kantian)
- Divine Command Theory
- Moral relativism
- Feminist ethics
- Evolutionary ethics
- Religious ethical systems

Now I have all the source material and can see the format you'd like me to follow based on your sample bibliography (which focuses on utilitarianism sources). When you're ready to create specific bibliographies, I can help you organize these references by topic, ethical theory, or any other criteria you have in mind. Just let me know what specific bibliography you'd like to start with!\

I've created a bibliography focused on deontological ethics based on the sources in your Google Doc. This bibliography includes chapters specifically dealing with Kantian deontological ethics from four different open access textbooks. Each entry follows the format you provided in your sample, including author names, chapter titles, book titles, URLs, and Creative Commons licensing information.\
The bibliography covers both foundational concepts and practical applications of deontological ethics, providing a comprehensive resource for studying this ethical framework.\

Are there additional references from the google doc that could be included in this list?\
Edit\
Looking back at the Google Doc, I don't see any additional chapters that are specifically focused on deontological ethics or Kantian theory beyond what I've already included in the bibliography.\
The chapters I included cover:

- Byars & Stanberry: "Deontology: Ethics as Duty"
- Gomez: Three chapters on Kantian ethics (main concepts, applications, criticisms)
- Kranak: "Kantian Deontology"
- Fisher & Dimmock: "Kantian Ethics"

The other chapters in the document focus on different ethical theories like:

- Virtue ethics (Aristotelian)
- Utilitarianism
- Divine Command Theory
- Moral relativism
- Feminist ethics
- Evolutionary ethics
- Religious ethical systems

Unless you'd like me to include some of these other ethical theories as contrast or context for deontology, the current bibliography captures all the deontological/Kantian content available in your source document. Would you like me to expand it to include related ethical theories, or keep it focused specifically on deontological ethics?\

Nope, that's okay. Let's do virtue ethics. Same format, please.\

I've created a comprehensive virtue ethics bibliography that includes all the relevant chapters from your Google Doc. This bibliography covers both ancient and modern virtue ethics, including:

- Ancient Athens and Chinese virtue ethics traditions
- Contemporary virtue ethics theory
- Character-based ethical approaches
- Aristotelian virtue theory and the doctrine of the mean

The bibliography draws from all five major sources in your document that address virtue ethics, providing a well-rounded collection of resources on this ethical framework.\

\* Jeffrey Morgan. "Chapter 2: Can We Have Ethics without Religion? On Divine Command Theory and Natural Law Theory." In Matthews, G., & Hendricks, C. (2019). Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics. <https://press.rebus.communit>\
I've created a natural law bibliography based on the sources in your Google Doc. There is only one chapter that specifically addresses natural law theory - Jeffrey Morgan's chapter that covers both Divine Command Theory and Natural Law Theory.\
This appears to be the only direct reference to natural law theory in the available sources. The other chapters focus on different ethical frameworks like virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology, and various other approaches, but don't specifically address natural law as a distinct ethical theory.\

I've created a Divine Command Theory bibliography that includes all the relevant chapters from your Google Doc. This bibliography covers:

- The relationship between ethics and religion, including both Divine Command Theory and Natural Law Theory
- A comprehensive two-part treatment of Divine Command Theory specifically
- Religious ethical systems more broadly

This provides a more substantial collection of resources on Divine Command Theory compared to Natural Law Theory, with dedicated coverage from three different sources.\

Does this include the natural law content as well? Let's combine if not...\
Edit\
You're absolutely right! The Jeffrey Morgan chapter covers both Divine Command Theory AND Natural Law Theory, so it should be included in both bibliographies. Let me combine them into a single comprehensive bibliography.\

Perfect! Now the bibliography covers both Divine Command Theory and Natural Law Theory in a single, comprehensive resource. The Jeffrey Morgan chapter that addresses both theories is included, along with the additional sources that specifically focus on Divine Command Theory and religious ethical systems more broadly. This provides a complete collection for anyone studying either or both of these religious-based ethical frameworks.\

Perfect! I can see this is "Ethical Explorations: Moral Dilemmas in a Universe of Possibilities" by Brendan Shea, which covers 12 chapters on various ethical theories. Looking at the overview, I can identify which chapters correspond to the bibliographies we've already created and need to be added. Let me check what specific chapters are available by looking at the table of contents more thoroughly.\

Perfect! I've now updated all three bibliographies to include the relevant chapters from Brendan Shea's "Ethical Explorations: Moral Dilemmas in a Universe of Possibilities." Based on the introduction, I added:

- Chapter 3: Duty Calls—Exploring Deontological Ethics to the Deontology bibliography
- Chapter 4: Virtue Ethics—The Role of Character in Moral Philosophy to the Virtue Ethics bibliography
- Chapter 5: Natural Law Theory—Exploring the Cosmos of Morality to the Divine Command Theory and Natural Law bibliography

Each entry follows your specified format with author, chapter title, book title, URL, and Creative Commons license information. This significantly strengthens each bibliography by adding Shea's comprehensive treatment of these ethical theories.\
