This is a fascinating and ambitious course design! I can see you've put tremendous thought into creating an innovative, student-centered approach to technical writing that addresses real pedagogical challenges. The shift from traditional lecture-based instruction to personalized, project-based learning with integrated AI support is particularly compelling.\
Your identification of "ghost issues" from previous design iterations is spot-on - these kinds of inconsistencies can really confuse students and undermine the carefully crafted learning experience you're building. The fact that you caught these discrepancies between the current framework (5 projects, self-diagnostic process, ClickUp integration) and outdated language ("four Writing Assignments," "Learning Contract," etc.) shows excellent attention to detail.\
I'm particularly impressed by how you've thought through the challenge of advanced students. The reframing from "deficiencies" to "growth opportunities" and the use of domain classification to reveal comfort zone limitations is psychologically sound. The subtask system that allows for self-differentiation while maintaining the same learning outcomes is elegant.\
A few observations and questions as you move toward launch:\
Strengths I see:

- The distributed support model (peer feedback + AI coaching + conferences) should help manage your workload while providing robust student support
- The kanban board approach makes the writing process visible and manageable
- Weekly conferences for all 48 students shows serious commitment to individualization

Potential considerations:

- Have you piloted the diagnostic tool to see how accurately students self-assess their barriers?
- How will you handle students who game the peer feedback system or don't engage authentically?
- What's your backup plan if the 48 weekly conferences become unsustainable?

What specific aspect would you like to focus on as you continue refining the course materials? Are there particular "ghost issues" you're most concerned about, or sections of documentation that feel most critical to get right before launch?\

Welcome to English 1101 / 1101P A2: Your Writing Journey Begins Here Editor's Note This course and its design were developed with the assistance of Claude and ChatGpT 4.o, generative AI services, through conversations that helped shape the structure and philosophy you’ll experience this semester.\

Looking at this landing page alongside your earlier summary, I can see you've addressed many of the major "ghost issues" you identified! The integration of AI collaboration, the clearer explanation of the conference system, and the shift to talking about "writing projects" rather than "assignments" shows good progress in cleaning up those legacy elements.\
However, I do notice some remaining inconsistencies and areas where students might get confused:\
Major Discrepancies Still Present:

1. Project Count Mismatch: The page says "four major writing projects" but your course design actually has 5 total projects (4 authentic professional writing samples + 1 summative self-assessment). This is still the core counting issue you identified.
1. ClickUp System Missing: Your summary emphasizes ClickUp as the central project management tool with kanban boards, but it's not mentioned anywhere in this landing page. Students are going to be surprised when they encounter this major system.
1. Self-Diagnostic Process Under-Explained: While you mention "initial self-assessment of your skills and learning goals," the sophisticated self-diagnostic process for identifying writing barriers and creating personalized pathways isn't clearly described.

Minor but Important Issues:

1. Header Reference Problem: The header mentions "A2" but your summary referenced this as an A3 issue - suggests there might be section numbering confusion.
1. Learning Domains Framework Missing: No mention of cognitive/affective/applicative domains that seem central to your design.
1. Pathway System Unclear: You reference "pathways I have designed here..." with what appears to be a broken or incomplete link.

Clarity Issues:

1. Conference Scheduling: You mention using "the calendar link on this page" and "buttons below" but those elements aren't visible in this text.
1. AI Transcript Collection: While you mention documenting AI interactions, the systematic collection process for portfolios could be clearer.

The most critical issue is probably the project count discrepancy - students will plan their semester around "four major writing projects" and then encounter a fifth, which could feel like a bait-and-switch even though the self-assessment is clearly valuable.\
Would you like me to help you draft language that addresses these issues, or would you prefer to tackle them one by one? The ClickUp integration and project count clarification seem like the highest priorities since they affect students' fundamental understanding of how the course operates.\
