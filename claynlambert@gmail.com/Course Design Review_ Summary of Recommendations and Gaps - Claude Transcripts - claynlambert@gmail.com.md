# <a name="_7zqjq14kzvul"></a>**Course Design Review: Summary of Recommendations and Gaps**
## <a name="_67parxjm5jkw"></a>**Critical Gaps Requiring Attention**
### <a name="_fgml63c3rztr"></a>**Part Definitions & Course Structure**
- Issue: The How-To Guide references "Parts 1-5" without explanation, and no document clearly outlines the semester's structural progression
- Need: Clear definition of what each "Part" represents and how they connect to the conflict map development process
### <a name="_ix6oq0ws3sd3"></a>**Dilemma Selection Support**
- Issue: Heavy emphasis on "measure twice, cut once" but limited scaffolding for this crucial decision
- Recommendations:
  - Early dilemma validation checkpoint or peer consultation process
  - Examples of strong vs. weak dilemmas (anonymized)
  - Instructor approval step before significant investment
## <a name="_kkqi7c6bz335"></a>**Scaffolding Enhancements**
### <a name="_8igzma1k6wei"></a>**Model Integration Guidance**
- Gap: Students choose their own sequence for ethical frameworks without guidance on dependencies
- Suggestion: Provide suggested pathways or prerequisite relationships between models while maintaining choice
### <a name="_56gbulaljpi7"></a>**Synthesis Support**
- Issue: Final integration step is highly complex with limited intermediate checkpoints
- Recommendations:
  - Mid-semester synthesis checkpoint
  - Examples of how integration differs from compilation
  - Scaffolded progression toward final synthesis
### <a name="_nj1dz3xsbd4k"></a>**Technical & Visual Support**
- Gaps:
  - No tutorials for visual mapping tools
  - Assumes comfort with ClickUp and AI platforms
  - Limited guidance on what effective ethical maps look like
- Needs: Basic tutorials, tool alternatives, visual examples
## <a name="_wgr1xcbcsx70"></a>**Process Optimization**
### <a name="_7hg082swc09"></a>**ClickUp-Course Integration**
- Missing Connection: How ClickUp tasks relate to conflict map evolution
- Need: Clear guidance linking project management to document development
### <a name="_tz4goh9zrvll"></a>**Peer Learning Enhancement**
- Current State: Thoughtful podcast system
- Potential Addition: Facilitation guidelines or question prompts to ensure productive conversations beyond progress reports
### <a name="_35w2bq8qsis9"></a>**AI Prompt Examples**
- Gap: General AI guidance but no course-specific prompt examples
- Suggestion: Sample prompts for different course tasks (dilemma exploration, model critique, role analysis)
## <a name="_rm2ob6xrx970"></a>**Assessment Refinements**
### <a name="_i6tnq3gpq3bk"></a>**Self-Assessment Examples**
- Enhancement: Provide anonymized examples from previous semesters showing different approaches (honest struggle, significant growth, creative language use)
- Purpose: Help students understand expected depth and candor without constraining individual approaches
### <a name="_u1lypjwz0ym5"></a>**Wreck Room Modeling**
- Need: Examples of effective vs. superficial model critiques
- Critical: Success depends on students understanding productive vs. cynical criticism
## <a name="_bxnpxk2pgrby"></a>**Documentation Clarity**
### <a name="_i2zqsex8y6al"></a>**Cross-Document Connections**
- Issue: Some elements referenced across documents need clearer integration
- Examples:
  - How weekly ClickUp updates connect to Monday-Tuesday feedback cycle
  - How podcast participation relates to conflict map development
  - How Wreck Room insights integrate with individual projects
### <a name="_ouotjjpepn51"></a>**Timeline Clarification**
- Gap: General semester arc described but specific milestone timing unclear
- Need: Clear calendar showing when major transitions occur (dilemma selection, model integration phases, synthesis period)
## <a name="_ya5vdvs5uwzl"></a>**Strengths to Maintain**
✅ Philosophical Coherence: All documents align excellently with core learning objectives\
✅ Student Autonomy: Balanced freedom with appropriate support\
✅ Authentic Assessment: Self-assessment approach serves learning, not just measurement\
✅ AI Integration: Thoughtful use as thinking partner rather than shortcut\
✅ Privacy Protection: Careful handling of personal dilemma confidentiality\
✅ Process Focus: Emphasis on reasoning development over predetermined answers
## <a name="_dcsvdjp6ueuo"></a>**Priority Order for Addressing Gaps**
1. High Priority: Part definitions, dilemma selection support, ClickUp integration
1. Medium Priority: Model sequencing guidance, synthesis checkpoints, technical tutorials
1. Lower Priority: Prompt examples, peer learning protocols, assessment examples

The course design is sophisticated and well-integrated. These recommendations focus on operational clarity and student support rather than fundamental redesign.\
