I can see you've provided a comprehensive design summary for your experimental career technical writing course. This looks like a well-thought-out pilot program with some innovative approaches - the kanban board project management system, authentic professional writing tasks, and AI collaboration integration are particularly interesting design choices.\
Looking at your current concerns, it seems like you're in the critical final stretch before launch with 5 weeks to clean up documentation and ensure consistency. The "ghost" issues you've identified from previous design iterations are exactly the kind of problems that can confuse students and undermine an otherwise solid course design.\
A few observations about your approach:\
The self-diagnostic pathway system is ambitious but smart - it addresses the perennial problem of mixed skill levels in composition courses. Your solution for advanced students (reframing as "growth opportunities" rather than deficiencies) shows good pedagogical awareness of student psychology.\
The distributed support model with peer feedback groups, AI coaching, and individual conferences creates multiple touchpoints without overloading any single support mechanism. Though managing 48 weekly conferences does seem like a significant workload consideration.\
Your concern about advanced student engagement is well-founded - the Dunning-Kruger effect is real, but so is the risk of genuinely skilled students becoming disengaged if they don't feel challenged.\
What specific aspect of the course design would you like to focus on or work through? Are you looking to tackle the documentation cleanup, refine particular pedagogical elements, or work through implementation concerns?\

Let's keep going with the refinement and proofreading of the student-facing documentation, then we can head back to some of these questions. Here's an updated version of the landing page, based on feedback.\
Edit\
Looking at this updated landing page, I can see you've made significant improvements based on your earlier analysis. The terminology is much more consistent now (Writing Projects, writing samples), and you've added crucial missing elements like the self-diagnostic process, ClickUp integration, and AI collaboration. The structure flows much better too.\
However, I notice a few remaining issues that could still confuse students:\
Minor Inconsistencies:

- The header shows "A2" but the first paragraph mentions "A2" again - is this supposed to be "A3" based on your course title?
- You mention "five Writing Projects" but then describe "4 writing samples + 1 self-assessment" - students might get confused about whether the self-assessment counts as a Writing Project or not

Clarity Issues:

- The peer feedback groups section could be clearer about when/how often these meetings happen during the class period
- The AI transcript collection process (end of class) might need a bit more explanation about why this matters for their learning

Technical Details:

- The ClickUp kanban explanation references an external link that may not be accessible to students yet
- The conference scheduling "buttons below" aren't visible in this document

Flow and Organization:

- The transition from "First Week" to "Your Personalized Learning Journey" feels a bit abrupt - you might consider restructuring to put the big picture concepts first, then dive into week-by-week details

Would you like me to help you refine any of these specific sections, or would you prefer to move on to reviewing other course documents? The overall structure is solid now - these are more fine-tuning issues that could prevent student confusion once the course launches.\

This summary captures the key points from our conversation about your career technical writing course design. The document highlights both the innovative aspects of your course (self-diagnostic pathways, AI integration, kanban project management) and the practical challenges you're working through in the final weeks before launch.\
The "ghost" issues you identified are common in iterative course design - it's easy for terminology and concepts from earlier versions to linger in documentation. Your systematic approach to identifying and fixing these inconsistencies should help ensure students have a clear understanding of expectations from day one.\
